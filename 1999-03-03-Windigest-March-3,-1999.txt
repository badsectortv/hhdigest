Subj:  RE: Happy Hacker Digest, Windows Edition, Feb. 23, 1999

HI.  After reading your section on "Secure M$IE Part 1 of Many"  
I fooled around with attemping to delete the history and temporary  
internet files folders and discovered a few things.  One way of  
removing these folders and deleting the DAT files without Norton  
Diskdoctor, is to simply remove the system attribute, and MOVE  
them to another location, where you can thenDELTREE them with  
impunity.  For example, I wrote a simple batch file that 
does the trick:

md c:\wipetemp 
attrib -s c:\windows\history 
attrib -s "c:\windows\temporary internet files" 
move c:\windows\history c:\wipetemp\temp1 
move "c:\windows\temporary internet files" c:\wipetemp\temp2 
deltree /y c:\windows\cookies 
deltree /y c:\wipetemp

The above removes the temporary internet files folder,  
as well as all those pesky system-named subfolders under it.

Subj:  Need a file find A file

Hello from denver,

I would just like to say if you ever need a file goto 
the following web adress

http://ftpsearch.lycos.com/?form=medium

This will have every single file you may ever need. 
For example ( I know im not supposed to do this but 
here goes )let look for windows 95 instead of typing 
win95 or windows 95 you type in win95_23.cab how 
about windows 98 type in win98_62.cab. i hope you get 
the drift of what im saying 

joshmcree

ps: the editor asked for something called 'strings' i 
need to know more about the  file to find the right 
one. there are millions of files called string.* or 
strings.* your search needs to be precise.

[Editor:  I am familiar with the search engine, and have  
used it in the past.  Thanks for bringing it up again.]

Subj:  Reply to Active Desktop

I've been messing around with the Active Desktop in my free  
time and there's been one thing that I've been wanting to do  
that I haven't found a way yet.  I want to put My Computer on  
the desktop.  Not just an icon, but the actual My Computer.   
I've put some VBScript buttons on the desktop (Try messing  
around with various VBScript things on your desktop. It's fun.) 
, but I have not yet been able to find or write a script that 
will put My Computer on the Active Desktop.  Anybody got any  
ideas?

Subj:  Reverse Engineering and Strings

In Feb 23rd Windows HH digest "Ezzy" mentioned he was looking  
for a URL to give him a start into reverse engineering programs  
("insert your own codes..."). The most comprehensive site for  
this kind of stuff can be found at Fravia's site. If you can  
manage to work through literally hundreds of pages and deal  
with the rather aloof and esoteric writing style then try the 
main page at http://fravia.org/ (which appears to be down right  
now) or one of it's several mirrors such as: 
http://www.phase-one.com.au/fravia/

Note to editor: I wrote a kind of "strings" equivalent for Win32  
files that runs on Win9x and I'm fairly sure will work on NT.  
It is not a command-line driven utility, instead it has a nice  
graphical user interface. It is of particular interest to programmers  
since it will show Ascii, Unicode and Resource strings together  
with information such as the memory address at which the strings  
are referred to at run time i.e. as shown by a decent disassembler.  
Grab this utility at:

well on my NT box.  I'll have to work with it some more, though, 
to see if it's what I'm looking for...

I was wondering if you could please help me with a problem  
I am having.  Somehow I lost the recycle bin icon on my desktop  
and have the lame flying window as the icon now.  I have windows

TCP/IP Resources

URI's TCP/IP Resources list... 
http://t2.technion.ac.il/~s2845543/tcpip_rl.html

Here's a URL from Yahoo (URL wraps...) 
http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/ 
Communications_and_Networking/Protocols/ 
*This URL is an excellent source of information...a great place 
to start reading about just about any protocol.

****************************************************************** 
Telnet, and why it doesn't work

Several readers have asked me this question...and I think I have 
an answer that everyone could use.

Many (yes, many...as in a lot of) readers have emailed me telling 
me that they are trying to telnet to their friend's computer and 
they can't connect.  I have had one or two that were sent to the 
Grand Poo-bah (ie, Carolyn) and then forwarded on to me.  Well, 
I'm here to tell you why it's not working...

The Internet operates on a client-server model of communications. 
This means that your PC has client software (browser, telnet, ftp, 
etc) and somewhere out there, on the wild, wide Internet, there  
are servers...web servers, email servers, ftp servers, etc.  To 
communicate to a server, you opent the appropriate client software. 
We'll use the web browser in our example.  You open your browser, 
and type in a URL.  Your browser then looks up the IP address of  
the server in question, and if it exists, tries to make a  
connection.  If the connection is made, the browser then requests 
that the server 'serve up' the appropriate page.  Easy enough,  
right?

Now, this works b/c there are web browsers, and web servers.  In 
the case of telnet, all of the Microsoft platforms ship with  
a telnet client...except DOS.  However, NONE of them ship with  
telnet servers!  Not even NT Server!  NT Server ships with an  
FTP server, and you can get other tools and servers, but  
Microsoft doesn't ship a telnet server with NT, 95, or 98.   
Therefore, when you try to connect to your friend's machine 
with your telnet program and you don't specify a port to connect 
to, the program tries to connect to the default telnet port; ie, 
23.  Since there is no server running there (not by default anyway) 
you won't get a connection.

****************************************************************** 
How Password Crackers Work

Ever wondered how password crackers like John the Ripper and  
L0phtcrack work?  Well, I'm not going to tell you where to get 
them...b/c, well, you can John the Ripper from any number of  
sites, and truthfully, it's pretty obvious where you can get  
L0phtcrack.  I thought I would simply discuss how the crackers 
do what they do, and talk about the usefulness of such things.

Okay, anyone who uses a computer is pretty familiar with passwords. 
Passwords are what's used as a form of security...the assumption 
is that a user has a password that only they know, and when used 
in combination with the username, the sysadmin can be pretty sure 
that only that user is logging in and accessing resources.

However, this isn't always the case.  Every since passwords were 
first used, the users themselves have always been the weakest 
link in the chain.  They use easy to guess passwords...like  
their username, for example, or the name of a spouse, child, 
pet, etc.  Some passwords are actually written down and pasted to 
the monitor!  There is the old joke about the difference between 
a secure and an insecure LAN being that on a secure LAN, you have 
to turn the keyboard over to see where the passwords are written 
down!  With the advent of cracking tools, sysadmins can check to 
see if passwords are easily cracked.  Then there are methods of 
protecting the passwords themselves...on Unix, there are  
'shadowed' password files.  Microsoft issued a dll in Service Pack 
2 that checks certain parameters of the password, and the User 
Manager on NT allows the sysadmin to set other conditions on  
passwords, such as requiring the user to change the password at 
certain intervals, minimum length of a password, etc.

When the sysadmin creates a user account, it often has a default 
password.  Many organizations use the username, or the username 
with a number, as the default password...and some don't use  
technical controls to require the user to change it.  That pass- 
word is encrypted using a one-way encryption algorithm...this  
means that the text password is encrypted, and you can't run  
the encrypted password through an algorithm to get the original 
text password back.  

When you sit down at the computer and type in your password, you 
see '*''s echoed back...that's how the textbox is programmed  
in case someone is shoulder-surfing.  What happens then is that 
the password you enter is encrypted with the same one-way  
algorithm used on your original password, and this new encrypted 
password is compared to the one that is stored.  If they are 
the same, then you are 'authenticated' by corresponding the  
username you entered to the correct password.

Now, since the passwords are encrypted by a one-way algorithm, 
the way a password cracker 'finds' passwords is by using a  
dictionary, or via brute force.  Using a dictionary works by 
taking a word from a list, encrypting it, and comparing it to 
the stored, encrypted password.  A brute force cracker works 
by trying combinations of keys, from the entire key-space (ie, 
all numbers, lower-case letters, upper-case letters, symbols, 
etc), encrypting each combination, and comparing that one to  
the stored, encrypted password.  You can see how using a strong 
password, one that you won't find in ANY dictionary, and isn't 
a name, would be very difficult to crack.  Not impossible, just 
very, very difficult.  A strong enough password will take far 
longer for a cracker to crack than someone is willing to wait.

****************************************************************** 
Building a Library

You've been surfing the net for a while, and you've got a lot 
of text files...to include the back issues of the GTMHH and HHD. 
Some of the files just don't make any sense to you...either the 
spelling and grammar are so bad they're just too confusing, or 
the files were grabbed from universities, and they are just WAY 
too technical.  So what do you do?  

Well, I would start at the library...you can get an understanding 
of the basics there...as well as a lot of other great stuff.  
Most libraries have a computer section and there are all sorts 
of books available.  Even though 4-6 months is a lifetime in the 
computer industry, some very basic things, like TCP/IP and net- 
working, haven't changed in a while.  So reading a book on net- 
working from 5 years ago is a good start.  Also, some of the  
older books on programming languages, such as C, are an  
excellent starting point.

Another resource that is available is the MacMillian Publishing 
site at: 
http://www.mcp.com

Here, you can create a 'personal bookshelf', and evaluate books 
for a period of time.  You can read 'Maximum Security', for  
example.  I recently added 'Upgrading and Repairing PCs' to my 
personal bookshelf...there are several excellent chapters about 
how hard drives and memory work.  If you are interested in  
programming, you can find books for VB, Perl, Java, etc.  There 
are many categories available.

A quick note on back issues of the GTMHH and HHD:  A reader  
recently asked me to compile an archive of back issues of the 
HHD b/c the archive at the Happy Hacker site is, well, a little 
behind.  The reader said that he'd been to the HHD archive site 
in Finland: 
http://w1.340.telia.com/~u34002171/hhd/gtmhh/svenska/hhdsvensk.html

However, the reader wanted the ASCII versions of the digests.   
Well, my first response was to go ahead and put the archive  
together.  But then it dawned on me...there is an easier way, and 
I don't have to duplicate the efforts of our Finnish friends. 
When you access the above site, just choose Edit -> Select All... 
in your browser, and copy the text of the page.  Then paste it 
into Notepad.  There, you're done!

If you have a library that you'd like to share with other HHD 
readers, put the information on a web page, and send me the  
URL.  Reader submissions are always welcome.  DO NOT send me  
a long list of links...just ONE URL, please.

****************************************************************** 
Exploits Explained

I get a lot of email from readers that starts of by saying "I'm 
an avid reader of the HHD...", but then the very first question 
has an answer from the last edition of the HHD!  Well, given some 
of the questions I have received recently, I thought I would cover 
a topic that I presented in a Guide a while back...just what is an 
exploit?  Here's the link to the Guide:

http://patriot.net/~carvdawg/exploits.txt

All the info here is still good.  Take a look at it...and if you 
still have questions, or still don't understand why you can't 
get telnet to work when you try connecting to your friend's  
95 box, let me know.

****************************************************************** 
Perl Corner

Well, I've promised this in the past, so it's about time I got  
around to presenting an example of creating GUIs under Perl! 
In this edition of the Perl Corner, I'll create a script that  
grabs information from system, and presents it in a nice GUI.

For beginners, O'Reilly and Assoc. has a 'Learning Perl/Tk'  
book available.  Check their web site for a sample chapter to 
the book, as well as an archive of the examples from the book: 
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/lperltk/

Also, the 'Web Client Programming' book from O'Reilly's has  
example available...a great Tk example is the 'webping.pl'  
script.  

Before we get started with Perl/Tk programming, we need the Tk 
module.  Go to:

http://www.activestate.com/packages/zips

...and download Tk.zip.  Use WinZip to open this archive into 
a directory called 'c:\perl\mods' (this assumes that you  
installed Perl into the default directory of 'c:\perl').  When 
you extract the archive, make sure you check the 'Use Folder 
Names' box...I am using WinZip 6.3.

Once you have extracted the archive, open a DOS prompt, and  
change directories to 'c:\perl\bin' and type: ppm.  You will 
recieve a ppm prompt:  PPM>

Type the following commands

set repository LOCAL c:\perl\mods 
install Tk

You may have to wait a few minutes, but the package will 
eventually be installed.  When you get the prompt back, 
type: query Tk

This will show you if Tk is installed.  Type 'quit' to exit 
the interactive PPM shell.

Okay, now we have Tk installed.  Let's put together our first 
script...and just like our first Perl script, we'll start  
with a 'Hello, World' implementation...

-----  begin tkdemo1.pl  ----- 
#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exe

# This script was taken from 'Advanced Perl Programming',  
# by Sriram Srivivasan, published by O'Reilly

# Use the appropriate module 
use Tk; 
$top = MainWindow->new(); 
$top->title("TkDemo");

# Put together our window 
$l = $top->Label(text => 'Hello, World!', 
                 foreground => 'red', 
                 anchor => 'n', 
                 relief => 'groove', 
                 width => 15, 
                 height => 3);

# Display the window 
$l->pack();

# This ends our event loop 
MainLoop(); 
-----  end tkdemo1.pl  -----

Okay, what we'll do next is build a little window that 
uses the Win32.pm module to show us some of the info 
about our system.  Now, this script can only be run on 
a Win32 system...it will NOT run on Linux (unlike many of 
our previous scripts).  Also, I have only tested this on  
NT...I don't have a Win95 or 98 system to test this on, so 
I have no idea if there are any problems.  I also don't  
know how this will work on 98...notice the array '@os'  
doesn't have an entry for 'Win98'.

-----  begin tkdemo.pl  ----- 
#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exe

# Import the necessary modules 
use Tk; 
use Tk::LabFrame; 
use Win32;

# Get our variables 
($string,$maj,$min,$build,$id) = Win32::GetOSVersion(); 
@os = qw(Win32s, Win95, WinNT); 
($drive,$fs,$flags,$maxpath) = Win32::FsType("C:"); 
$bp = Win32::BuildNumber(); 
$ln = Win32::LoginName(); 
$nn = Win32::NodeName(); 
$dn = Win32::DomainName();

$mw = MainWindow->new(); 
$mw->title("SysInfo");     
my $f1 = $mw->LabFrame(-label => "Operating System", 
         -labelside => "acrosstop");    

$f1->Label(text => "$os[$id] $maj\.$min $string  
                   Build: $build")->pack;     
$f1->pack;

my $f2 = $mw->Label(text => "File System:  $fs")->pack; 
$f2->pack;

my $f3 = $mw->Label(text => "Perl Build:  $bp")->pack; 
$f3->pack;

my $f4 = $mw->Label(text => "Login Name:  $ln")->pack; 
$f4->pack;

my $f5 = $mw->Label(text => "Node:Domain:  $nn:$dn")->pack; 
$f5->pack;

MainLoop(); 
-----  end tkdemo.pl  -----

Again, this script was not fully tested...I just don't have 
the systems available.  The purpose is just to give you a  
brief introduction to Tk.  Later, we will look at event bindings 
and other ways to make use of this GUI system.
