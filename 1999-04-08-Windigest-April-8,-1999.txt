Wow.  After a brief hiatus, we're back with two quick digests. 
One of them has a question that has spurred more responses than 
anything I have seen thus far...the Strange URL question (all of 
the responses I received by the time I sent this to edition of 
the digest to Carolyn are listed...).

Subj:  Changing the windows98 startup and shutdown screens

I'm posting this one for the people who missed it and still 
wanna know how to change those boring startup and shutdown screens 
.. so Keydet98 won't have to type it all out but can jsut copy&paste 
it :)  If this gets posted on the next HH Win edition of course.

Ok, the first thing to do is to check if you have a c:\logo.sys file. 
This file is actually just a BMP file(BitMap), it's a graphics file. 
It could be hidden, or read-only or set as system file. 
To check if it's a hidden file, open an MS-DOS prompt, type cd \ and 
then 
type

attrib *.sys

This shows all *.sys files, no matter what their ATTRIButes are. 
If you haven't got the c:\logo.sys file, I suggest you copy your 
c:\windows\logow.sys file to your c:\, because the file size is 
kinda weird, and the pic is cropped up. 
Now, then you type attrib *.sys and you have the file, you could 
e.g. get something like the following:

C:\>attrib *.sys 
  A  SHR     MSDOS.SYS     C:\MSDOS.SYS 
     SHR     IO.SYS        C:\IO.SYS 
     SHR     LOGO.SYS      C:\LOGO.SYS 
  A          CONFIG.SYS    C:\CONFIG.SYS

As you can see here, this logo.sys has SHR attributes, which means 
System, 
Hidden and Read-only. 
Unset those attributes by typing: attrib logo.sys -s -h -r 
Then rename the file by typing: ren logo.sys logo.bmp 
Now you can write to the file. 
Open it in Paint, or if you have a better graphics editor, open it 
in there.  It's very handy to adjust the size of the image to 640x480, 
and then to crop it back to it's original size when you're done editing 
it.  After you've made changes to it (or maybe even totally replaced 
it), go 
to your MS-DOS prompt again, and rename the file back to logo.sys (ren 
logo.bmp logo.sys), and set the attributes back(attrib +s +h +r 
logo.sys) 
The Shutting Down and It's now safe to blablabla screens work by the 
same routine, except they are located in c:\windows (or whereever you 
installed win) 
Have fun :)

[Editor:  Aaahhhh!!  Does it ever end?  Not more 'how to change 
your win9x startup'!!!]

From:  "Gibney, Tim" <TGIBNEY@WMDSP.COM> 
Subj:  Not the place but...

...try it anyway.

Heh...  try this in IE5.  Trust me the last part is good :)

Open up IE5 
>From the menu, select Tools > Internet Options > General (tab) 
> Languages (button)

Press 'Add' 
Type: "ie-ee" (without the quotes) and click 'OK' 
Move "User Defined [ie-ee]" to the TOP of the list 
Exit back to where you can browse in IE5 again 
Click on the Search icon (to pull up the side search menu) 
Laugh at the new options 
Select 'Previous Searches'

Regards, 
Tim Gibney

[Editor:  I don't use IE5...so I haven't tested this one...]

Subj:  HHD Submission

Recently someone had asked about a web server running under Windows. 
Here is one I installed and had a lot of fun experimenting with. I 
never got to experimenting with CGI or scripts but it is easy to 
install, 
use and works well. Best part it's free. They even send notices about 
upgrades which reminded me about the question on HHD.

a web server, I would hold off until I had a platform on which 
I could set some security...]

From:  DataHaze@aol.com 
Subj:  Re: IOther help for AOL

1. Connect to a proxy from there you can ping, traceroute, telnet 
and other Internet related hacking things. There is a list of them 
a www.theargon.com.

p.s.- do you know or know anyone that could help me-Im writing a 
TSR keystroke recorder in c++.

[Editor:  You don't ask for much, do you, DataHaze?!  ;-) 
I haven't tested out any of the proxies at the listed site... 
I don't use AOL.]

From:  "John Leckert" <hardenbrook@ignmail.com> 
Subj:  I wanna give you all this.

While I was talking on IRC, I got a guy called XIX to give me his 
page. I found it to be real interesting and different from other 
"hacker's" pages. (You know, with those floating skulls and either 
outdated progz and Back Oriface or with great and interesting philez 
that have the link dead on all the good ones.) Well, it has stuff like 
a emulator that emulates a PC and runs on a PC called Bache.(You can 
run Linux on Win 95!) I am also confused with the Win 95 version on how 
to use the Telnet method.

about regarding 'the Telnet method'...]

From:  Will <mtgshivan@yahoo.com> 
Subj:  Winmodems

I would like to warn everyone against buying 
Winmodems. Formerly USR, they are now sold by Lucent, 
and come pre-installed in a number of Windows boxes. 
If you can, buy a box that does not have a Winmodem 
installed. They are 80% software; Winmodems rely on a 
Windows .VXD file, so they cannot be used with Linux. 
It is not very likely a Winmodem driver will ever be 
written for Linux, either. I found this out the hard 
way, by trying for 2 hours to get my 56k to work with 
Minicom, then going online and searching futilely for 
a Winmodem Linux driver. Bottomline - don't let anyone 
foist a Winmodem upon you.

[Editor:  Our daily religious rant brought to you by Will! 
I love it!]

From:  Sage6985@aol.com 
Subj:  question

I'm beginning at this whole thing, and don't really know where to 
get some info on editing the Registry.  I'll make my question short: 
Where is the best place to get info on it?

The thing I want to find out is if I can edit my Registry so that 
other users on it can't go to a certain section of the hard drive. 
I would guess that you would have to edit the User area of the Registry.

I don't want to disable MY access to that section of the disk, so I 
don't 
want to "test" with it.  Would you have any idea if what I want done, 
could be done.  I know it can be done to a network, but can it be used 
on a PC.  Thanks for all the other info on your site, though.  keep up 
the good work!

[Editor:  I would suspect that what Sage is looking for is ACLs, 
or access control lists.  If he's using win9x, he's out of luck... 
unless 98 has some nifty little tool...I don't know, I don't use 
it.  You can only set ACLs on NT, and then only if it's formatted 
in NTFS.  But either way, it has little to do with Registry settings. 
You have to set the ACLs on the files and directories to do what 
Sage want's to do...]

Subj:  .

Hey, just wanted to say a bit about dragonlinux, which is 
available at http://www.dragonlinux.nu 
This is a umsdos, compact version of linux and is really easy 
to install. No need to partition or to do any real setting up. 
Just copy the files over to a dir and start it up from DOS. It 
seems to hang a little bit when using certain programs but other 
than that its great for new users.

[Editor:  Also remember, there is the Slackware version ZipSlack, 
and the Trinux distro called TrinuxHD.  So if you really think 
you need to get a Linux distro, any of these is a good place to 
start...no need to re-partition your hard drive, etc...]

Strange URLs...the answer

Okay, ever since this subject came up in the HHD, I've gotten 
tons of email...so much so that I have only listed the two 
differentiators...the 'dotless address' vulnerability, and 
the explanation of the address format.  I have also included the 
C and Perl code (see the Perl Corner for the Perl scripts) that 
two readers provided.  For everyone else...if you submitted an 
email to me on this subject, then you should see your name listed 
below...

From:  "Quassum" <Quassum@iname.com> 
Subj:  Reply Hhd, Question about IP adress

I write you regarding your email in the Happy Hacker Digest 
Windows edition. 
You mentioned those strange addresses, they are called dotless 
ip addresses, read all about it here:

Please reply to me in case this url helps you.

**************  and  *******************

From:  Simon Ekstrand <simius@algonet.se 
Subj:  Re: Question about IP address

Here we go, I'll try to explain this. 
3505003744 is an ip adress stored as binary data in 
host byte order (on an x86 host byte order is little endian, 
ie. least significant byte first). 
In the example in C below we convert it from host byte order 
to network byte order (ie. big endian, most significant byte 
first).

A quick example would be:

little endian stuff (host byte order on an x86): 
        decimal: 3505003744 
        binary : 11010000 11101010 00011100 11100000 
        ip-addr:      208      234       28      224 
 

Included below is a small C program that tries to show 
how this works.

------ cut ------

#include <sys/socket.h> 
#include <netinet/in.h> 
#include <arpa/inet.h>

void version_one(unsigned long int a) { 
        unsigned char m,n,o,p;

        m=a >> 24;              // = 208 
        n=a >> 16 & 0xff;       // = 234 
        o=a >> 8 & 0xff;        // = 28 
        p=a & 0xff;             // = 224

        printf("version one: %d.%d.%d.%d\n",m,n,o,p); 
}

void version_two(unsigned long int a) { 
        struct in_addr in; 
        unsigned long int b; 
        unsigned char m,n,o,p;

        b=a >> 24; 
        b+=(a >> 16 & 0xff) << 8; 
        b+=(a >> 8 & 0xff) << 16; 
        b+=(a & 0xff) << 24;

        in.s_addr=b;

        printf("version two: %s\n",inet_ntoa(in)); 
}

int main() { 
        unsigned long int a;

        a=3505003744; 
        version_one(a); 
        version_two(a);

        return 0; 
}

[Editor:  Does anyone with Cygnus installed have this 
compiled?  No, I don't want it, just thought I would ask...]

Hope this helped a bit.

From:  RavenBlack <raven@ravenblack.net> 
Subj:  Long-number IP addresses

I would have thought you would have been able to answer 
this one, Carolyn. It's similar to the effect of Perl command 
'pack'. 
Look at hexadecimal... 
208 = D0 
234 = EA 
 28 = 1C 
224 = E0 
Then the number D0EA1CE0, when turned to decimal, produces... 
3505003744

It's the internal format of an IP address.

Sharp today,

DOS Revisited  "FuzzyFlup" <flup@telekabel.nl>

I'm one of those people who used to use MS-DOS, until Windows95 came. 
Everybody suddenly had it, so ofcourse I couldn't stay behind :) 
The problem is, I still liked DOS a lot more, especially because I 
ran on a 486dx2-66, so Windows didn't run too well :) 
I often just pressed F8 when you see "Starting Windows95..." (or 
something like that), entered the boot menu and booted in a MS-DOS 
prompt.  There was a time when I did almost nothing in Windows, and 
everything in DOS.. so I got kinda sick of pressing F8 every time. 
If you would like to let your Windows95/98 system boot up in MS-DOS, 
do the following:

First, back up your c:\msdos.sys and c:\msdos.--- 
Unset the System Hidden and Read-Only attributes of the file 
c:\msdos.sys by 
typing attrib -s -h -r msdos.sys

Then edit the msdos.sys file, and look for a line saying

"BootGUI=1"

If it's not there, add it under [OPTIONS] 
Change the 1 to a 0 (BootGUI=0)

Then save the file, exit your edit screen, and set the attributes 
back by typing attrib msdos.sys +s +h +r.

Then proceed with working on the msdos.--- file. 
This file only has the +h (hidden) attribute. 
Unset it: attrib msdos.--- -h 
Edit the file, it shoudl contain a line saying "BootGUI=0" 
Change it to a 1 
If you don't have the line, just add it under [OPTIONS], if you don't 
have the file, just create it.

Save, exit your editor, set the hidden attribute: attrib msdos.--- +h 
Reboot your system, and poof.. you start in MS-DOS! 
Optionally, you could turn the startup logo off too, by adding "Logo=0" 
under [OPTIONS] in your msdos.sys... personally, I hate that screen :) 
Well I know this info may be a bit outdated.. but it's just my two 
cents.. 
cya :)

[Editor:  One thing is for sure...DOS isn't dead yet!  Yes, there 
are a couple of machines left running DOS...and as long as Win9x 
is around, some of the things you learned in DOS, such as writing 
batch files, will still be useful.  Besides, writing a batch file 
is a heck of a lot easier than learning VBScript...]

****************************************************************** 
Secure M$IE Pt. 2 
"Dr. Malkav" <malkavian248@yahoo.com>

Well, I'm back. Today we will go over secure M$IE from 
ActiveX/JavaScript/VBScript related holes. Let's get to the lesson:

Micro$oft isn't stupid. They allow you to send files to servers. This 
feature comes in handy when you are making an attachment to a file. 
They designed it so that the script can not put a value into the form, 
preventing the web page from grabbing your files. But, there was a 
fatal flaw. They allow the scripts to copy and paste. This allows the 
script to just cut and paste the file it wants and M$IE will happily 
send the file to anybody. This is called the Cuartango, named after the 
man who discovered it. Here is the code for it:

document.forms[1].T1.select(); 
document.execCommand("copy"); 
document.forms[0].filename.select(); 
document.execCommand("paste"); 
document.forms[0].submit();

Five lines of JavaScript, and your autoexec.bat file can be floating 
around the net. But Microsoft fixed the problem, calling the Untrusted 
Script Paste hole. (From now on, USP) Did they? Later, a new variant 
was discovered. The Son of Cuartango allowed the same thing to happen, 
only with an extra step. They added a hidden variable form that then 
pasted into the file box. With only one extra line of code, the patch 
can be foiled. This hole can also be implemented within HTML e-mails. 
Sound like trouble? It is.

But, again, Micro$oft patched the USP. But did they miss it still. The 
Grandson of Cuartango showed up. That's right, Grandson. I am not 
exactly sure as to how this works. It takes an MS Forms 2.0 box and 
copies the contents of that into an ActiveX box, allowing the website 
to take your files. This explanation is sort of vague, because there is 
not much info on this hole. But, I know that it uses a variation of the 
other two Cuartango holes.

Where did these holes come from? Faulty programming? Laziness? Or a 
Communist conspiracy? You decide. The only way to be completely safe 
from these holes is to disable JavaScript, ActiveX, and VBScript. Good 
luck and safe browsing.

Perl Corner

First off, Echo Four <echofour@on-net.net> contributed some 
Perl code with regards to the unusual URL format...

# dot2dec.pl - converts dotted-quad IP addresses to their 
# decimal equivalents 
# By echofour on 4/3/99 
# usage: dot2dec.pl [dotted-quad address]

# Get dotted-quad address entered on the command line

$addr = shift;

# We're adding an extra step to the regular expression to 
# make it slightly more readable. 
# $ln is a _l_egal _n_umber in an IP address - that is, a number 
# from 0 to 255.  One or two-digit numbers may be zero-padded on 
# the left.

$ln = '([01]?\d\d|2[0-4]\d|25[0-5]|0?0?\d)';

# If the argument to the script isn't four dot-separated legal 
# numbers and nothing else, quit right now.

die "Invalid IP address $addr:$!" if ($addr !~ /^$ln\.$ln\.$ln\.$ln$/);

# Divide the address into its components 
@digits = split (/\./, $addr);

#  Let's start from the smaller numbers and work up.  Since 
#  IP addresses go from larger to smaller, we'll first reverse 
#  the order of our numbers.

@digits = reverse @digits;

for ($i = 0; $i <= 3; ++$i) {

    #  Multiply the smallest number by 1, the second smallest by 
    #  256, the third smallest by 256 squared, and the largest by 
    #  256 cubed, and add the result to our running total $sum.

    $sum += $digits[$i] * 256 ** $i; 
}

#  Print out sum and th-th-that's, all folks.

print $sum, "\n";

# End dot2dec.pl

And a terse version for oldbies (the following code is all one 
line):

perl -e "for(reverse split(/\./,shift)){$s+=$_*256**$i++}print$s" 
206.61.52.31

[Editor:  The above is all one line...it's sort of a  Zen thing 
with Perl programmers...to be able to have enough knowledge of 
Perl to reduce most, if not all, scripts to a single line.  Hat's 
off to the author...]

# dec2dot.pl - converts decimal IP addresses to their 
# dotted-quad equivalents

die "Invalid decimal IP $addr:$!" if (($addr =~ /\D/) 
    or ($addr > (2 ** 32) - 1));

# The decimal address is related to the dotted quad 
# as follows: 
# 
# decimal = 1st * (256 ** 3) + 2nd * (256 ** 2) + 
#           3rd * (256) + 4th 
# 
# We can find our component numbers by repeatedly 
# taking remainders, subtracting, and dividing.

$fourth = $addr % 256; 
$addr = ($addr - $fourth) / 256; 
$third = ($addr % 256); 
$addr = ($addr - $third) / 256; 
$second = $addr % 256; 
$addr = ($addr - $second) / 256; 
$first = $addr % 256;

print "$first.$second.$third.$fourth";

# End dec2dot.pl

Crunch crunch (again...the following code is all one line):

perl -e 
"$a=shift;while($a){unshift@a,($a%256);($a-=($a%256))/=256}print 
join'.',@a" 3460117535

[Editor:  ...again with the one-liner...]

Okay, that being said, let's get one with the Perl Corner. 
Today's Perl Corner was sent in by Ben Jackson 
<ben@bensheila.demon.co.uk>...here it is (NOTE:  All I've done 
to the script is edit it to fit the page, and make a couple 
of comments...otherwise, it's all Ben's work):

I've been reading your excellent Perl corner since it started 
and have recently started coding some Perl.

The other day whilst reading some free Perl documentation I 
stumbled on a section regarding srand / rand.

This coincided with a review of *NIX password security at my 
workplace.

So I thought I'd write a "Random password generator" in Perl 
and here it is.

As is the case with the examples in Perl corner  this could be 
used as a springboard for other applications, I intend to add 
into it the functionality to change a users passswd via passwd 
and then send the user an E-mail to their mail client informing 
them of their new *NIX password.

Here's the script, hope you find a space for it.

Many times, lately, I have received questions about articles 
in the Unix edition of the HHD.  Folks, I edit the Window 
edition.  If you have a question about something in the Unix 
edition, please...ask the Unix editor.

I also receive email all the time from readers who want to know 
how to 'hack' or 'root someone's box'.  I'm sorry, but we don't 
do that.

I appreciate questions...and answer as many as I can.  I also 
appreciate contributions from the readers...
