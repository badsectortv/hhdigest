Okay, the second edition of the HHD with Keydet89 at the reigns 
is out!  Following the release of the first edition, I got a lot 
of emails, and I am sorry that they can't all be posted here.

Helping You Help Yourself

Everyday, I get emails asking for help in all sorts of areas.  Many 
times, I don't know the answer, and I will say so.  Sometimes, I or 
someone else has already answered that question in a Guide or Digest, 
so I suggest that the person review the text.  I try to direct someone 
to the answer if I don't know it.  But I like to observe a quote from 
the Bible that says "if you give a man fish, you feed him for a day; 
if you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime."  So I 
thought I would take a minute to show you how to help yourself...

The key to helping yourself is to gain knowledge...in fact, that's 
what REAL hacking is all about...just go to the library and get a 
copy of Steven Levy's "Hackers".  In fact, the library is an excellent 
source of information.  My local library, for instance, not only 
has books on Unix and Windows OSs, but it's also where I got my first 
look at "Learning Perl on Win32" from O'Rielly and Assoc.

If you have a more detailed question, and can't find the answer in 
one of the books in the library, check out some online sites.  For 
example, you'd be surprised at what you can find at the Microsoft 
Support Site (http://support.microsoft.com) and their Security 
Site (http://www.microsoft.com/security).  In fact, any time you 
have a problem with software or hardware, check out the manufacturer's 
web site first.

If you still can't find what you're looking for, go to DejaNews 
(http://www.dejanews.com) and do a search.  DejaNews searches the 
newsgroups for you.

If your question is about how to do something in Linux (and believe 
me, I get a lot of Linux questions, even though I am the Windows 
editor!!), check out the Linux Documentation Project at:

http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/ldp.html

This site has links to HOWTO documents, which will explain how to 
do just about anything you would like to do in Linux.

The Yahoo site has excellent links to software for operating 
systems, and tutorials for programming languages.  Many times, if 
you just post your question to a newsgroup, it will be ignored at 
best, or mercilously flamed at worst.  Why?  Well, did you check and 
see that that very same question had been asked and answered 5 times 
a day for the past month?

The key to "hacking" has nothing to do with breaking into computers. 
The key is to learn...and in doing so, learn to help yourself.

Update to Alternative OSs 
I received an update from an attentive reader... 
"Luka Grah, Gimnazija Kranj" <luka@s-gim.kr.edus.si> 
Go to:  http://www.qnx.com/iat/index.html  to learn more about 
the QNX Internet Appliance Toolkit.  The IAT is a complete system 
on a disk...for either modem or network connections.  I haven't 
tried it, but it looks promising!  Thanks, Luka!

Here's another one I've been watching...it's not Windows...it's 
Linux.  But it's worth a look anyway...http://www.trinux.org. 
Read about it...it looks interesting...

****************************************************************** 
Cover Your Tracks in Netscape 
**NOTE:  I did not test this one... 
This one was submitted by Per Haglund <p.i.haglund@lse.ac.uk> 
n the last Happy Hacker digest (Jan. 7th) there is a section submitted 
by Kalanga Joffres that describes how you delete entries from the 
Netscape 4.x history list (and IE 4.x). Good enough, but there are at 
least three more places in Netscape that show where you have surfed:

The disk cache: In users/username/Cache copies of pages, images and 
sometimes java-applets are stored. Delete them manually or in netscape: 
Edit --> Preferences --> + advanced --> Clear disk cache.

The cookies file: If you accept cookies without warnings then you can 
either edit away unwanted entries (users/username/cookies.txt) despite 
what 
the comments in the file say as long as you only remove complete parts 
(starting with an url and ending with some numbers, followed by the 
next url), or, for future protection from snooping, turn off cookies 
in netscape: Edit --> Preferences --> Advanced --> disable cookies

The typed-url history: When you type an url in the location field, 
Netscape will store the url so that you can select it from the 
pull-down menu on the side of the location field. You can remove 
entries from this "mini-history" by opening the file users/username 
/prefs.js (right click and choose edit) and removing lines that look 
like this:

user_pref("browser.url_history.URL_5", "www.rivazone.com/");

If you are not familiar with Javascript please note that you have to 
remove the semi-colon at the end (not sure what happens otherwise, 
but it probably won't work). Just remove the entire line that contains 
the url you don't want others to see.

Editor's Comment:  Hey, reader submissions are always appreciated!! 
As long as everyone else's input is treated with respect, you'll see 
more of it.  Because of the mass of email, not everything can be 
checked and verified...I would like to ask that from now on, if you 
have an update or different technique, put it on a web page and 
email me the URL.  It's much easier to include in the Digest.

****************************************************************** 
Port Scanning Revisited 
Alert reader Dave Garn <dgarn@osf1.gmu.edu> asked that we address 
the issue of some of the things you will see while port scanning. 
I thought that I could cover that here...see if maybe I could address 
the issue satisfactorily.  Here goes...

For the most part, straight port scanning takes advantage of the 
3-stage TCP handshake to determine what ports, if any, are open on 
the remote machine.  Ports allow the various clients to communicate 
with the server...without the various ports, you'd only be able to 
telnet or ftp or send email to a server.  Using ports, you can do 
all these things, and more!  See the next section for a link to 
the Assigned Ports RFC (RFC = Request For Comments).

Now, what will you see?  Well, it all depends.  If you use telnet 
and connect to an IP address using the default port (port 23), 
and see a lot of information, you might have stumbled across a 
router or switch without a password!!  So what do you do?  Find the 
email address of the sysadmin and send him an email via the 
Anonymizer!!

What else will you see?  Again...depends.  What IP and port are 
you looking at?  What tools are you using?  Telnet?  Netcat? 
A port scanner?  Several of the available service issue a banner 
when you connect to them...ports like 21 (FTP), 25 (SMTP), and 
110 (POP3).  If you telnet to these ports, then the first thing 
you will see is the banner for this service.

Now, here I have to point something out...telnetting to a port 
only works if there is an active service on that port.  There is 
nothing that says that all servers must have telnet and mail 
servers running.  On top of that...95/98/NT don't ship with 
telnet servers...so unless one is installed, you generally won't 
be able to connect to the server.  But if you think about, you 
can use this piece of information to help you determine what 
operating system is running on the remote machine.  For example, 
a host with port 23 (Telnet) active likely isn't NT.  Now, 
this technique isn't always accurate, but it's a way to get 
started.

****************************************************************** 
Ports Revisited 
"Arran Pearce" <arran_p@hotmail.com> wanted a little explanation 
that follows right along with the previous topic, with regards to 
what ports on a server do what.

Well, the place to look is RFC1700: Assigned Numbers.  A quick 
search on Lycos found a copy at:

http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc1700.html

Basically, the idea is this...ports between 1 and 1024 are 
referred to as "well-known"...everyone on the Internet uses the 
same port for the same service.  SMTP always runs on port 25, 
etc.  Of course, we aren't going to get into esoteric discussions 
about proxy servers and redirecting ports...let's just keep it 
simple for the time being.  Ports over 1024 are client ports...when 
your browser, for instance, wants to make a connection to a 
web site on port 80, it has to open up a port locally for 
communications, as well, so it chooses a random port above 
1024.

A reader asked about "screwy" stuff...well, keep an eye on TCP 
port 12345, and UDP port 31337...these are the default ports for 
NetBus and BO, respectively.  As far as telnetting to ports and 
seeing something you don't recognize...well, be careful.  You 
don't want to accidently cause damage, and have your IP "finger- 
prints" all over the place!!

****************************************************************** 
IP Spoofing Revisited 
Reader Francesco Frentrop <frentrop@car.nl> dropped me an email, 
asking that I address IP Spoofing...particularly via a Win95 
box and dial-up ISP account.

Let me start by saying that there is a misconception about subjects 
such as spoofing and "hacking" in general, particularly amongst the 
newer users.  One has to be careful where they mix and match terms 
because they can cause a lot of confusion.  In this case, I think 
that Francesco _meant_ to ask how he could hide or mask his IP 
address, but what he _said_ was spoofing.

Before I get into the explanation, let me say that there are some 
excellent texts located at the URL posted above.  Go to the URL 
and look for "tcpspoof.txt".  This one was written by the Secure 
Networks guys (before they were bought by NAI).  Also look for 
"sequence_attacks.txt" and "shimomur.txt".

If you've ever been on alt.hacker or alt.hacking, you'll see several 
posts a day..."I have 95..how can I spoof my IP".  But to understand 
why you can't do this, you need to understand something about TCP/IP 
and routing.  You see, as packets travel across the Internet, the 
header information contains both the source and destination IP 
addresses...the packet needs to know where to go, and it needs to 
tell the remote box where to send responses.  Now, the term 
"spoofing" is used to refer to changing your IP address, or the 
source IP address of the packets, so that you can look like 
someone else to the remote machine.  Well, there are attacks that 
use this technique, but they are very, very sophisticated...they 
involve sequence number prediction, etc.  These types of attacks 
are generally run from Unix or Linux boxes, because the operating 
systems allow you to have very detailed control over the creation 
of IP packets...if you know how.  This is how the SYN Flood attack 
works...the attack that brought down Panix a while back.  The 
attacker sent thousands of TCP SYN packets to the server a second. 
These packets attempt to initiate a session with the server...so 
the server has to allot some resources to the request, and then 
go about trying to respond to the requesting station.  But it 
can't find that station, because the destination IP address 
has been "spoofed"...so as the requests come in, more and more 
resources (memory, etc) are alloted, until the server runs out of 
resources for anything else.

Now, assuming that you _could_ spoof your IP address, let's 
examine what would happen.  You want to contact a remote machine 
and you want to hide "who" you are.  Okay, fine.  So you "create" 
a packet, but the destination IP address is not the same as the 
one for your computer.  So when the remote machine receives the 
response, it tries to reply to the destination IP address...but 
even if it does find the address, it's not YOUR address.  So you 
can send packets, but not get anything back...well, not without 
a lot of other work...so what good is that.

Now that brings up the issue of masking your IP address...which 
is not the same as spoofing.  Masking your IP address is simply 
using another facility, such as a proxy or a shell account, to 
make the target machine think that you are coming from the 
proxy.  Here's how it works:

You have a browser configured to access a web proxy.  You send a 
request for a web page, and the proxy services it...the proxy 
sends the request to the target.  Now, the target sees a request 
coming from the proxy...which has a different IP address than 
yours.  The proxy then forwards the response to you...

Step 1.  Issuing the request.

[u.u.u.u]  -->  [p.p.p.p] 
  You             Proxy

Step 2.  The proxy forwards the request.

             [p.p.p.p]  -->  [t.t.t.t] 
               Proxy           Target

**To the target, the request is coming from IP "p.p.p.p"

Step 3.  The response is sent to the Proxy

             [p.p.p.p]  <--  [t.t.t.t] 
               Proxy           Target

Step 4.  You get the response from the Proxy.

[u.u.u.u]  <--  [p.p.p.p] 
  You             Proxy 
 

Now, the same is true when you use telnet and a shell account or 
two.  You mask the IP address of the computer you are sitting at 
by telnetting to one or more shell accounts and then telnetting to 
the final target.  This uses the same principle as was described 
above.

****************************************************************** 
Win95 hacking and nbtstat

To this day, I still get many emails a week asking about accessing 
Win95 machines via the Internet, and the two biggest questions I 
get are:

1.  "I try to run nbtstat, and I get an error about 'could not 
access NBT 1 driver' or something to that effect".

2.  "Tell me why I get 'host not found'".

Let me take a minute to address those two...but first, let me point 
you at the Guide that I wrote on this subject:

http://patriot.net/~carvdawg/win95.txt

This is the latest version...it even includes references to info 
from Micro$oft.  Now, to answer the first question...you need to 
install NetBEUI.  The vulnerability that this technique takes 
advantage of is the fact that a default installation of NT or 95/98 
tells NetBIOS to use TCP/IP...making non-routable NetBIOS accessable 
via the Internet.

I briefly touched on the second topic in the Guide, but let me try 
again...first, the purpose of using nbtstat is only to (a) get the 
NetBIOS name of the remote computer, and (b) see if file sharing is 
enabled.  Now, if you are having trouble with nbtstat, try calling 
your friend.  Or, read the PGP Guide at:

http://patriot.net/~carvdawg/pgpguide.txt

...and pass the information back and forth encrypted.

Now, if you get 'host not found', there could be any number of 
reasons for this.  Nbtstat uses UDP...'user datagram protocol'... 
which is an unreliable protocol.  Unlike TCP, there is nothing in 
the protocol that guarantees receipt of or response to the message. 
So if traffic is heavy on the 'Net, then you might not get a 
response before the timeout, so the app will respond with "Host Not 
Found".  Further, your buddy might not be logged on at the IP address 
that you have, or there could be a firewall blocking UDP between 
the two of you.

****************************************************************** 
ASM Programming

I got two emails regarding ASM programming, and I am going to post 
the contents here...but please understand, I haven't tried any of 
the links, nor have I tried any coding...but for everyone interested, 
here they are:

>From Weazel (weazel_@gmx.net): 
Perl for Win32 is perhaps OK and Java will be better soon (i think) but 
nothing beats old Assembler. Now you think that I'm a stupid cracker 
writing my patches in 8086 DOS-assembler, but that's not correct. OK, I 
know how to crack, but that's my work (I'm a protectionist). But 
assembler is still alive. Now with the true 32-bit power! And it's not 
difficult at all! You don't have to care about interrupts, or anything 
about old DOS... I've done a lot of programming in Delphi and the 
difference between Delphi (or C++) and Win32 Assembler is not that big! 
And it's FREE too! The best advantage with Assembler is the size of the 
EXE... Minimum 4 kb, but a normal util won't be bigger than 8-16 kb!!! 
Try to beat that with your overbloated language!

Where to start? Try to find Microsoft Assembler (MASM). However, I 
rather use Turbo Assembler, but it's not very cheap. I don't want to 
tell you where to find it, but you will probably do so if you really 
want it.

>From PBBSER:

For free windows utilities I have a few to add to the list.

Microsoft has MASM 6.1 in the windows98 ddk.  I don't know if the 
install will work on win95 but I know MASM 6.1 does, in fact it only 
requires DOS 6.0 (I think).
