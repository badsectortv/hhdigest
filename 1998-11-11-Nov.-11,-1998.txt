* Dale Holmes news 
For all you people who have been wondering why the Digest hasn't come out 
for two weeks -- sorry, our fearless editor, Dale Holmes, has been busy with 
some health problems of his wife.  She's only seven weeks away from her due 
date for delivering twins, which is not an easy job. Meanwhile, your Grand 
Pooh-bah, Carolyn Meinel, is expecting twin granddaughters this spring .. 
what is it about the Happy Hacker scene that is making all these twins happen? 

* New, up-to-date web site!   
Check out http://www.happyhacker.org for archives of recent GTMHHs and 
Digests, and lots of great links and Wargame information.  Not only have we 
finally revamped the Happy Hacker Web site, it's on a new server, 
fishbone.happyhacker.org.  Our beloved fishbone is an OpenBSD box just like 
its predecessor zlliks.505.org.  (OpenBSD is a form of Unix.)  Because 
zlliks has performed so well in the hacker wars, it is soon going to work 
for our sponsor Rt66 Internet doing, let's just say, cool stuff.

* Wargame news!   
All you folks who wanted an easy to attack computer, where were you the last 
several weeks when we had a relatively vulnerable fishbone.happyhacker.org 
lurking on the Happy Hacker T1?  Take heart, fishbone is still much more 
open that zlliks -- time to study the archives at http://www.rootshell.com 
and http://www.netspace.org/lsv-archive/bugtraq.html for exploits!  For your 
best shot at taking over fishbone, install OpenBSD on your own computer (it 
runs on most varieties of computers). You can download OpenBSD for free at 
http://www.openbsd.com.  Then try out whatever you plan to do to fishbone on 
your own computer first.  That way, if something you try doesn't work, you 
can figure out what went wrong from your own OpenBSD box while logged in as 
root. Expert hackers say this is a much faster way to learn how to break in 
than attacking an uncooperating box like fishbone.  Plus -- remember, to win 
the Wargame, you need to keep control after you break in.  To make sure you 
know in advance how to fix whatever hole you use to get in, you need to 
practice on your own OpenBSD box first.

* How do you find out what Wargame computers are on the Happy Hacker LAN?  
Actually, soon after fishbone went up on the T1, I (Carolyn) was delighted 
to see a number of people already trying to break into it.  That means some 
of you Wargame players are keeping track of what we have on the Happy Hacker 
LAN.  For the rest of you, here's how to spot a new Wargame box.  

1) The only way to break into one of our Wargame boxes is to use a Unix type 
computer for the attack.  The best attack Unix is probably Linux.  One 
reason for this is that the majority of the attack programs (exploits) you 
find at Rootshell etc. were written for Linux.  So first install Linux and 
get on-line with it.  OK, maybe you really need two or more computers to 
learn to be a great hacker, one to practice using for attacks, and the other 
being your defender computer.

2) To keep track of what is on our Wargame, use your Linux box (or a Unix 
shell account at an ISP of your choice) to give the nslookup command on a 
box you already know is in the game.  For example:

~ > nslookup fishbone.happyhacker.org 
Server:  chili.rt66.com 
Address:  198.59.162.6

Name:    fishbone.happyhacker.org 
Address:  198.59.118.60

2)  Now try nslookup on nearby IP addresses, for example: 
~ > nslookup 198.59.118.61 
Server:  chili.rt66.com 
Address:  198.59.162.6

Name:    unused61.happyhacker.org 
Address:  198.59.118.61

4) Wowie, is "unused61.happyhacker.org" a newbie box on the Wargame?  Don't 
get all excited yet.  The Wargame is run by the 505 gang, and they like to 
fool people.  So the next step is to use the ping command see if there 
really is a computer named unused.happyhacker.org in the game: 

~ > ping unused61.happyhacker.org 
ping: unknown host unused61.happyhacker.org

See, they were just faking you out. However, if there really is a computer 
at an address on our LAN, you will get:

~ > ping koan.happyhacker.org 
koan.happyhacker.org is alive

Or depending on your ping program, something similar, for example:

Pinging koan.happyhacker.org [198.59.118.51] with 32 bytes of data:

Reply from 198.59.118.51: bytes=32 time=149ms TTL=252 
Reply from 198.59.118.51: bytes=32 time=141ms TTL=252 
Reply from 198.59.118.51: bytes=32 time=126ms TTL=252 
Reply from 198.59.118.51: bytes=32 time=129ms TTL=252

5) Now suppose you find a live computer while checking out nearby IP 
addresses.  How do you know it is really in the game, instead of a computer 
that you can get into trouble for attacking?  Nslookup comes to the rescue 
again:

~ > nslookup 198.59.118.62 
Server:  chili.rt66.com 
Address:  198.59.162.6

Name:    knight.505.org 
Address:  198.59.118.62

Notice this is a 505.org box instead of a Happy Hacker computer.  That means 
it isn't in the Wargame.  Only computers with "happyhacker.org" in their 
name are OK to attack.

* Rules for fishbone.happyhacker.org 
OK, suppose you get root on fishbone.  What can you get away with doing to 
her?  Obviously, if you want to keep control, you'd better leave the Happy 
Hacker website there.  We work on it in the home/cmeinel directory, which 
has a symbolic link to var/www/htdocs/ where the actual web page files 
reside.  If you are good enough to take over fishbone, you'll be good enough 
to figure out how to put your own Web site up at 
http://fishbone.happyhacker.org while leaving it so requests for 
http://www.happyhacker.org go to var/www/htdocs/.

Other than that, the general Wargame rules apply, as posted at 
http://www.happyhacker.org/hwgstart.html.  Most important, you can't use 
fishbone for any illegal activities.  Also, our firewall, knight.505.org, 
will prevent you from making telnet or ftp connections to any computer 
outside the Wargame.

How do we enforce the rules?  Ask anyone who has spent much time on 
koan.happyhacker.org.  Hint: while on koan's guest account, give the command 
"man lart".

How do you get into koan.happyhacker.org's guest account?  Hint: the 
password is really stupid.  Even a stupid person can guess it.  To see what 
the people who have broken into the guest account have to say, check out 
http://koan.happyhacker.org/~guest/.  If you break in, you get to add your 
say to this Web page.

* How to break into koan.happyhacker.org? 
Koan is a FreeBSD box (a kind of Unix).  Your first step in getting root on 
koan is to install FreeBSD on your own computer.  You can download FreeBSD 
from http://www.freebsd.org.  Then -- sorry, you won't find exploit programs 
for koan anywhere.  You have to create your own!  This is a tough box -- it 
has been up since mid-September and no one has rooted it!  It will probably 
take a team effort to win the game.  To meet others who are trying to root 
koan, go to the IRC channel #koan on Undernet.

If you really want fun, when you break into koan's guest account, try this: 
koan% who 
guest    ttyp0   Nov 16 22:44   (208.250.172.216) 
guest    ttyp3   Nov 16 22:56   (152.203.210.91) 
guest    ttyp4   Nov 16 22:58   (shell.rt66.com) 
koan% w 
10:59PM  up 1 day,  7:39, 3 users, load averages: 0.27, 0.13, 0.05 
USER     TTY FROM              LOGIN@  IDLE WHAT 
guest    p0  1Cust216.tnt40.d 10:44PM     - vi any-erect.c 
guest    p3  203-210-91.ipt.a 10:56PM     - -tcsh (tcsh) 
guest    p4  shell.rt66.com   10:58PM     - w

That tells you where the other players are and what they are doing.  In this 
case, the fellow on "tty0" is using the vi editor to write a C program (vi 
any-erect.c).  Since vi is a somewhat advanced editor program, we hope this 
fellow may know a thing or two.  So.. you want to meet this guy, huh?  Just 
give the command "talk tty0" and if he or she wants to talk with you, you 
will soon have a private conversation going.

* How are people doing on koan?   
Satori is doing a magnificent job maintaining root on koan.happyhcker.org. 
Normally, by allowing people easy access to a guest account, Satori should 
have quickly lost koan to someone else.  There are many more ways to get 
root starting from inside a shell account than there are from outside a 
computer.  However, as anyone who has played with the koan guest account has 
discovered, Satori has figured out many ways to keep control.  Even so, one 
player did manage to at least get telnet going from the guest account. 
Cryptik (who ran the first Wargame computer cyrptotek.happyhacker.org) 
looked in the file usr/bin/telnet and saw:

-r-xr-xr--   1 bin   wheel    69632 Sep 17 15:08 telnet*

The last three spaces of that "-r-xr-xr--" means that people who are 
ordinary users such as "guest" could "r" (read) this file but not "x" 
(execute, which means run) the telnet program.  Oh, yes, we know it is a 
program because of the asterisk after the word "telnet".  

So Cryptik copied that file into the guest directory and got it to run and 
was telneting around our LAN -- until Satori caught him.  Now that trick 
won't work any more.  Satori, you are a tough man to try to beat!

* Big news is coming up soon with Happy Hacker.  You may have been hearing 
rumors about Happy Hacker Grand Pooh-bah Carolyn Meinel (yes, me). Stay 
tuned for interesting revelations:):)

* The second edition of The Happy Hacker book was shipped from the printer 
(after much delay) Friday 13, 1998 -- a truly auspicious day!  The second 
edition is a 400 pages, large format paperback book, up from 262 pages in 
the first edition.  For more details see 
http://www.happyhacker.org/hhbook.html.  What does the new cover look like? 
Beats me, I haven't seen it yet!  The publisher says he wants to surprise 
me.  Last time he surprised me by using a cartoon of me wearing a nose ring 
on the cover.  Bletch, I *hate* nose rings. What did he do to me this 
time????  Hey, maybe this time you are on the cover!

OK, I, the Grand Pooh-bah, am signing off now.  Happy hacking against 
fishbone and koan!
