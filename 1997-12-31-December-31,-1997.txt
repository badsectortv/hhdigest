	*** Am I in Trouble?
==================================================

From anonymous:

Help me!  I was reading a web site and it said if you type in a website
followed by a bunch of junk which doesn't make sense to me it would bring up
a password or something.  I tried this and it brought up a page that said:

United States Code 2701


2701. Unlawful access to stored Communications


(a)Offenses -

(1) intentionally access without authorization to a facility through which
an electronic communication service is provided; or

(2) intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that facility; and
thereby obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to a wire or
electronic storage in such system shall be punished as provided in
subsection (b) of this section

(b)Punishment - The punishment for an offense under subsection (a) of this
section is -

(1) if the offense is committed for purpose of commercial advantage,
malicious destruction or damage, or private commercial gain -

(A) a fine of not more than ,000 or imprisonment for not more than one year,
or both, in the case of a first offense under this subparagraph; and

(B) a fine under this title or imprisonment for not more than two years, or
both, for any subsequent under this subparagraph; and

(2) a fine of not more than or imprisonment for not more than six months, or
both, in any other case.

By using this bug to obtain the password file or any other information you
have just committed a felony. We will press charges to the fullest extent of
the law.

All log information is sent to root of this system, Computer Crimes Division
in Washington D.C. and to root of the offending system

All telephone, IP connection, reverse host lookup information, inetd is
logged and provided to the Computer Crimes Division at their discretion. All
investigations and criminal procedures are directed through the Federal
Bureau of Investigation

XXXXXXXX is through the Department of Information Technology and with
Computer Crimes Division
Command not found.

***end of message***

does this mean I am in a lot of trouble?  I really didn't even know what I
was doing!

[Carolyn: They are just trying to fake you out. In the United States, to
commit a felony you have to actually download the password file, run it
through crack, and actually get some passwords from it. A more friendly Web
site someone pointed out to me responded to this (which is, FYI, the "phf
exploit") with a flashing message "Smile! You're on Candid Camera!" Even if
it were a crime, there is way too much serious computer crime out there for
the Feds to waste their time on it. Oh, in case you guys are curious, the
phf exploit is
"http://victim.computer.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd"
But don't expect it to work. If you do get a password file, don't go crying
to me if you crack it and go to jail. Also, you don't have to break the law
to get kicked off your ISP or expelled from school. So think twice about
trying this lame hack.]

	*** Static vs. Dynamic IP Addresses
==================================================

From: James Parrish - cyberspy@slip.net

     I just discovered your mailing list, it's awesome!!! Finally,
something that explains UNIX shell stuff in ENGLISH!!! Anyway, I have a
friend who lives in Hong Kong, and I live in the US. I wanted to know if
it was illegal if I would finger him and get some info. When you say
it's illegal to telnet and "break-in" what do you exactly mean? Well,
thanks a lot. Also, have you discussed the significance of ppp
addresses in any of your notices?

[Carolyn:  It is only illegal (at least in the US) if you break into a part
of a computer that requires a secret password. And it is amazing how many
computers -- millions -- on the Internet have ports that allow anyone to use
them. 

I don't recall whether I have discussed PPP addresses, but sometimes they
are dynamic, assigned each time at random from a group of IP addresses owned
by your ISP, and other times you might have an arrangement with your ISP to
get the  same IP address each time you log on.]

==================================================
	***How to Get HTML Source Code
==================================================

Please anonymize this:

Suppose your browser won't let you view the source.  Well that is really
easy to fix.  The URL for the source code is very simple. In the URL box
type:

view-source:http://www.thewebpage.com


replace http://www.thewebpage.com with the webpage you want the source
to.  This info could be used for many different things.  here are some
reasons to use this.


1.  Give the URL to your source code.
2.  Maybe you are having problems with viewing the source of a frame
document. (then again, you could open up Netscape Communicator and right
click on the frame window and click on open frame in new window.  it's
something like that.)
3.  Afraid of the page doing damage to your computer, well then, just
type that in and you don't have to view the page but you can view the
source.
4.  You think of more ideas.

Subject:      Viewable .jhtml source with JavaWebServer
To: BUGTRAQ@NETSPACE.ORG

It has been discovered by Min Chang that there is a security
vulnerability in the 1.1Beta version of JavaWebServer for win32.
Similar to the IIS viewable source bug, if you append a '.' (period) or
a '\' (backslash) to a .jhtml URL, the server will display the source.
.jhtml files are html files with embedded Java code that are supposed to
be compiled and returned to the client (sans the java code).  Because
these files can have things like jdbc queries or important server
filenames embedded in them, it is a security risk.

examples:
http://localhost/xyz.jhtml.
or
http://localhost/xyz.jhtml\

	*** LILO Help
==================================================
From: SamWilJoe 

I too, am installing Linux on my system and came across something in a book I
was reading on the topic.  The book said that Linux didn't like it's boot
partition being on cylinder 1023 or above of the hard drive.  You might try
repartitioning your hard drive so that the boot partition is below that limit.

From: Star Morin

What that user should do is to user the boot floppy that he created to
install the system load his system up.
Just boot the floppy, and when it gets to the section where it asks for
additional parameters, type:

mount root=/dev/hda1

if that is the partition that he has his install on. Once there, type "lilo"
at the prompt. Once that is done, go on the net to www.linux.org and read
the lilo howto

Star Morin

From: Maximo B. Salviejo

Hello...I just wanted to add something to this section of the article..

I'm use Linux myself...(Red Hat 4.2 running kernel 2.0.3.0) <---best kind of
Linux I might add--anyway...I use Linux and Win95 on the same box...I had
tons of trouble in it.  In fact, it took me like a month to install it on my
PC until I realized my CD-ROM wasn't being recognized, so quit installing
and waited for my new PC
to install it into.

OK, to get to the point..There are more ways to boot up Linux other than
LILO....I boot Linux using LOADLIN... LOADLIN is a probably on that CD that
you have..if not you can probably download it from a Linux
site...anyway..you take that program and u save it under DOS and then you
edit your CONFIG.SYS in DOS.

This is what I did:

1.I made a Linux folder in Win95 saving LOADLIN and VMLINUZ in there...
2. This folder should be under the C: (or what ever drive your Windows/Dos O/S
are) and it should not be a subdirectory.
3. I went into DOS and edited my CONFIG.SYS this is what it looks like:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


[CONFIG.SYS]

[menu]

menuitem=linux, "Linux 2.0.30"

menuitem=win95,"Should be shot O/S"

menudefault=win95,10

[linux]
shell=c:\linux\loadlin.exe c:\linux\vmlinuz

[win95]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save this and then reboot the system. This will give you a prompt to choose
which O/S you want to boot, Linux or "the other O/S system", also giving a
timeout to that other O/S--in this case win95

Well I just thought I'd share these to you Linux-newbies...I myself am a
newbie (really just started yesterday if you don't count that previous
month)...I enjoy linux and I'm sure I'll enjoy it more after I learn
everything.  Its tough but hey I like it.  Another advice is to READ..I
always hated reading, but this is something I enjoy. So read the HOWTOs,
buy/borrow books about Linux.  Trust me you'll need it. As for newbie
Hackers..Linux is something to HACK..safe and LEGAL!!!! Hack the kernel,
then recompile it.  Remember, Linux is a Unix PC-based operating system,
after u learn LINUX.  You've practically learn most of Linux commands.

Well I don't know if this is going anywhere...like I said, I thought I would
just share this..Please no FLAMES...I get enough of that!!!

HACK THE PLANET!!! ----LEGALLY
hehe
MAX  (look for me at #ComputerTalk, #Windows95, #linux ---mIRC)

From: pc2000

This is a response to the LILO problem. I myself don't use/like red hat
but for linux newbies it is good. I don't even Like lilo either so I use
loadlin. I have managed to make my home made boot manager using just
loadlin and autoexec.bat. Here is how my dual boot (win95 linux) setup is:

First I have a loadlin app in my c:\windows\command for path rights. 
Then for my boot manager I modified my autoexec.bat to look like:
----------------------- autoexec.bat start
---------------------------------
@echo off
CHOICE /c:yn /T:N,30 Shall We Boot To LiNuX Instead?
if errorlevel 2 goto win95
if errorlevel 1 goto linux

:win95
NORMAL WIN95 START UP STUFF GOES HERE
goto end

:linux
SET PATH=C:\windows;c:\windows\command
loadlin d:\linux\vmlinuz root=/dev/hdb1 rw

------------------------------- cut here
------------------------------------------

Now lets break this down:
"CHOICE /c:yn /T:N,30 Shall We Boot To LiNuX Instead?"

gives you a choice of booting to win95 or linux, u press y or n. then it
has a timer for 30 seconds to default to linux ( /T:N,30 )
You can change it to default to win95 by changing the N to Y or even add
more/less time by changing number.

"NORMAL WIN95 START UP STUFF GOES HERE"

just all the stuffs that's normally there right now (i.e. path tsr apps
whatever)

"SET PATH=C:\windows;c:\windows\command"
"loadlin d:\linux\vmlinuz root=/dev/hdb1 rw"

Now I have linux installed on d: and it is the secondary hard drive (slave)
on my system. You will have to figure out what yers falls. Here is a quick
table of most common ones:

hda1 = c: or first partition on primary hard drive
hda2 = secondary partition on primary hard drive
hda3 = third partition on primary hard drive
hda4 = fourth partition on primary hard drive

hdb1 = first partition on secondary hard drive.
hdb2 = secondary partition on secondary hard drive
hdb3 = third partition on secondary hard drive
hdb3 = fourth partition on secondary hard drive

-------------

Please note that it isn't the same for everyone as far as hdb or hda because
I have 2 hard drives installed. My 2.5 gig is split into two partitions. A
1.0 gig c: which is hda1, then a 1.5 gig partition that is e: or hda5 yes
that's a 5 not sure why tho. Then I have a 1 gig which makes up d: or hdb1. 

This system works for me nicely and I recommend it as an alternative to
LILO if it doesn't work for you. Or if you want a real boot manager I
suggest getting System Commander 4 deluxe which allows multiple os's to
boot plus allows re-partitioning hard drives w/o formatting. Need more help
or have questions u can email me on the side at: pc2000@dangerous-minds.com
and I will be more then happy to assist you.

	*** How to Go to Jail
==========================================================

From anonymous:

Carolyn,
I'm a newbie to cracking, but experienced in UNIX, HP-UX and FreeBSD.  I
have read several of your tips and am yearning for more information.  I
tried the "finger" tip and wasn't able to get what I wanted.  It only
allowed a users name to be put in.
Basically, what I am looking for is on a FreeBSD school system.  I looked
for the master.passwd file and wasn't able to find it.  The regular password
file seems to be shadowed.  I know users names and I know their passwords
are their Social Security Number. What I don't know is how to really get in
deep to get that information.  I was trying to find a program (script) that
would run from Win95 or DOS that would enter the user's name and then
increase the number by one each time the login fails.  Have you ever heard
of anything like that?  Can you help me?

[Carolyn: You could easily write such a program in Perl or C. You also would
get kicked off your ISP and/or out of school, and possibly end up in jail.
This is because it would be so incredibly easy for the sysadmin of the
victim computer to notice your activities and identify you.]

	*** Header Questions
==========================================================

From: andy vance

hi, I sent some messages from a hotmail account to an aol account to
see how long it would take but I discovered something when I was going
through the headers. I don't know if you already know this but if I
could figure it out then you probably do. I read somewhere, I think it
was in the happy hacker digest, that sending email using hotmail was
just about as anonymous as you could get (without using a remailer).
Because you could type in fake info when you signed up.
Here's the part of the header:

    Fri, 19 Dec 1997 16:40:46 PST 
X-Originating-IP: {206.133.70.48}
From "my name" <my email address@hotmail.com>
At first I thought the X-Originating-IP was hotmail's IP address but I
wanted to be sure. So I did an NSLookup and there was nothing. So I
tried pinging it, it was alive. Then I had an idea, why not traceroute
it? So I did. Here's what I got:
Friday, December 19, 1997 09:21:41PM

TraceRoute to host 206.133.70.48

 
1. 206.***.**.3 sdn-**-001fl***003t.dialsprint.net     2. No response
from this hop                         
3. 206.***.**.48   sdn-ts-002fl***P13.dialsprint.net
(The parts i replaced with *'s were exactly the same)
               
Now I'm very new at this sort of thing but I think that means it had
my IP address in there. If this is true wouldn't that mean its not as
anonymous as people think? Thanks :)

[Carolyn: I would need to know what your originating IP address is in order
to find out if this is a problem., here is how we find out stuff about the
hotmail originating IP:

First I type in the command:

	#nslookup

It gives me a default server, but I want to pick my own:

>server 206.133.70.48
Default Server:  sdn-ts-002flmelbP13.dialsprint.net
Address:  206.133.70.48

What I just did was find out that that IP address runs a Domain Name Server
(DNS). So with the server command I set up for my shell account to use
206.133.70.48 as the DNS server. This automatically told me the name of that
computer, sdn-ts-002flmelbP13.dialsprint.net. This is a Sprintnet backbone
computer -- highly unlikely to be your ISP, as backbone providers don't
normally give out individual accounts (unless you want something like a T1!)

However, when I tried to learn more about it, I got:

>206.133.70.48.
Server:  sdn-ts-002flmelbP13.dialsprint.net
Address:  206.133.70.48

*** Request to sdn-ts-002flmelbP13.dialsprint.net timed-out

This is typical behavior of an Internet backbone host. So next I try:

>bash$ dig sdn-ts-002flmelbP13.dialsprint.net

This makes it toally obvious we are dealing with an Internet backbone
provider. But is it Hotmail's backbone provider? If yes, no problem. If no,
maybe it is revealing the IP address of YOUR Internet connection.

So I try a traceroute to Hotmail:

Hmmm, looks bad. But that doesn't necessarily mean anything. For example, my
domain name of cmeinel.com maps to a Web server address of hway.net,
while my POP server for cmeinel.com maps to rapidsite. So it could easily
be true that Hotmail uses different IP addresses for their outgoing email
than you get when tracing a route to their primary web server (the www part
of the name is the tipoff that it is their Web server we were going to, not
necessarily their mail server.)

To finish this analysis I would need to know the IP address of the computer
that gave you Internet access when you logged on to send out this hotmail
stuff. Here's how you can tell: do a traceroute from your computer (if your
are on Windows 95, go to DOS and do "tracert hotmail.com" or any IP address,
it doesn't matter, you only need to see the FIRST IP address in the route,
for example,

C:\WINDOWS>tracert foo66.com

* Errata (translation: admissions we've messed up)
===========================================================

In the previous Digest, mention was made of a hacker arrested in San
Antonio. He was not arrested, but was raided, with the expectation that he
would be arrested shortly. We are hopeful that we can prevent the planned
arrest from being made, as we have reason to believe he may have been
falsely implicated by the real culprit sniffing his IP address and spoofing
it while vandalizing computers.

In the December 1 Digest, an article was erroneously attributed to Carolyn
Meinel: "Major security flaw in Cybercash 2.1.2," a Bugtraq post from "jet"
who posted from an anonymous remaileer.

she could never have gotten past our security.  

But I'm going to find her and see that she's prosecuted ...  
she broke the law, and she's going to pay!"
