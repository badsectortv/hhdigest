Opening Comments

I've gotten a lot of email asking me to address certain issues in 
the digest...see the article on cookies below.  I approached the 
solution for the article on cookies the way I did, b/c I wanted to 
show the readers how easy it is to find information on their own. 
If you haven't noticed, that's my goal, pretty much, for the  
Windows edition of the HHD.

I've noticed a couple of trends recently in the emails I have 
received, and I'd like to address them individually:

1.  Please don't ask me how you can break into a machine.  I've 
said time and again, that's not the purpose of the HHD.

2.  Many readers start by saying something like "I've been  
reading the digest for some time now..." and then they ask a  
question that was answered in a recent digest.  I still haven't 
figured that one out yet.

3.  Folks like Carolyn and I, and others involved with the HHD,  
all have day jobs.  The HHD is a voluntary effort on our parts... 
so please don't ask us to do your web surfing for you.

4.  If you have a question, I am more than happy to help, if I  
can.  However, many readers make it very difficult to help...they 
don't provide enough information, or they write their emails using 
'h4x0r skript'...which I instantly delete.

Thanks!

Cookies

Cookies...what are they?  More importantly, what do they mean to 
the security of my computer?  Well, I started by doing a search 
on Yahoo -> Computers and Internet -> Internet, and boy, did I find 
a LOT of information!!

One of the best sites that was returned was: 
http://www.cookiecentral.com/

There is an interesting FAQ with other links at: 
http://www.vermontguides.com/faqteg14.htm

Okay, given that, just what the heck is a cookie?!  A cookie is an 
HTTP header that is entered into the memory of your browser by the 
server, so that state information can be maintained.  Things such 
as last access date, etc, are stored in cookies and then read by 
the server the next time that you go back to the site.  So there  
does seem to be some legitimate use for the cookies...to prevent 
the user from having to remember data entered at a site 6 months 
ago, or having to type a TON of information into a form time and  
time again.

But what about security issues?  Well, I checked the FAQ at  
CookieCentral (see the above URL) and the response there was:

"2.4 Are Cookies Dangerous to My Computer? 

NO. A cookie is a simple piece of text. It is not a program,  
or a plug-in. It cannot be used as a virus, and it cannot access  
your hard drive. Your browser (not a programmer) can save cookie 
values to your hard disk if it needs to, but that is the limit of  
the effect on your system."

For more info, and the answers to many of your questions, check 
the FAQ out at:

Tiramisu!

Not too long ago, I received an email from "Balduin Butterkeks" 
<meierk@weiden.de> or <butterkeks7@yahoo.com>, in which he  
attempted to review the product known as Tiramisu!  Well, largely 
due to the language barrier...our friend Balduin is German...I 
didn't think it wise to post the review 'as is' in the Digest,  
but I want to thank him for pointing the product out and bringing 
it to my attention.  So, all credit, recognition, and kudos for  
this entry in the digest go to Balduin!

This tool is used in an area of computer security called 'digital 
forensics'.  In digital forensics, you use tools and knowledge 
to determine what happened in a security incident.  This basically 
involves either determining how a security compromise was  
accomplished (ie, how someone 'rooted' a box) or gathering data 
from systems (hard drives) as part of an investigation.  As you 
probably guessed, this is something that a lot of law  
enforcement people (FBI, Secret Service, etc) do.  But just b/c 
the police do it, doesn't mean that you can't learn about it! 
Let's take a look at Tiramisu!...

Tiramisu! can be found at http://www.recovery.de

Tiramisu! is a data recovery tool that allows you to access  
information on your hard drive that you didn't think you could. 
The product information page is pretty comprehensive, and you 
can download a demo of the product, but only after you register. 
I think it's definitely worth a shot, even just to try out for 
a trial period.

OnTrak Software has some other products in addition to the data 
recovery software, so take a look at some of them.

Tools like Tiramisu! work by reading the unused blocks on your 
hard drive.  Here's how it works:  your hard drive is broken up 
into many smaller sections, sometimes as small as 4k.  The  
programs and data on your hard drive are stored in these blocks. 
The end of the first block contains a pointer to the next  
sequential block in your program or data:

    -------------                    ------------- 
    | 0x00c123   |         --------> | 0x00c134   | 
    -------------         |          ------------- 
    |            |        |          |            | 
    |            |        |          |            | 
    |  <data>    |        |          |  <data>    | 
    |            |        |          |            | 
    |            |        |          |            | 
    |            |        |          |            | 
    |            |        |          |            | 
    -------------         |          ------------- 
    | 0x00c134   |   -----           | 0x00c147   | 
    -------------                    -------------

This goes on until your program or data is ends.  Now, when you 
delete the data, the first block is marked as unused...which 
makes all sequential blocks unused, as well.  But the data 
remains...and this data can be read by tools like Tiramisu!

Now, this was a very simple, very general description of what 
happens, with regards to digital forensics and deleted files.   
To find out more detail regarding how a particular operating  
system handles blocks and deleting data, you need to read up  
on the particular file system in question.

Along the lines of data recovery and computer forensics, here is  
another interesting site:

http://www.forensics-intl.com/

This site has a lot of great information regarding computer  
forensics.

What about deleting files from your hard drive so that they  
can't be recovered by tools like Tiramisu!?  One such app I  
ran across is WipeClean, from JCL Software: 
http://www.jcldev.com/wipecln.htm

There are other such tools available...and I'm not going to  
list them all here.  If someone has one or two links, please 
don't send them in.  If you have many links, to apps and info 
on the subject at hand, put that all on a web page, and send  
me _that_ URL.  Thanks!

Viruses

I got a call the other day from someone regarding the CIH virus  
affecting Win95 and 98 systems.  Well, I hadn't heard too much  
about it, so I decided to look into it.  I started with a quick 
search for 'cih' on DejaNews, and I paid particular attention to 
any posts to the alt.comp.virus newsgroup.  Well, I found some 
really interesting links!  No, I'm not going to go into how viruses 
are written...I won't make it that easy for you!  But I will  
provide the links I found, b/c they make some very interesting  
reading...

First, check out the DataFellows site.  Reading this site is like 
a cross between a zoo and a medical research lab...have you  
ever heard someone describe a computer virus as being "in the  
wild"?? 
http://www.datafellows.com/v-descs/

The DataFellows site should be part of your library, if you are 
at all interested in computer security...

Also, for anti-viral solutions, check out: 
E-Safe:  http://esafe.com

Command Central:  http://www.avp.com/

F-Prot:  http://www.complex.is/

With the proliferation of viruses on the Net, you need to be 
very careful.  Some viruses are annoying, but harmless.  Others 
are very destructive.  From my experience, military and government 
sites are not only the biggest targets, but the biggest offenders 
when it comes to keeping anti-virus software up to date.  If you 
must swap disks and CD-ROMs and programs with outside sources, and 
you absolutely cannot afford to loose any data, I would highly  
suggest that you have at least two anti-virus packages, one of them 
being F-Prot.  And keep them up to date!!

Who am I talking to?  Lawyers.  Anyone who is a military  
reservist (I have friends who have yet to return from a drill w/o 
a virus!!).  Anyone who does a lot of outside work or trading 
of documents, especially anything from Microsoft Office, via 
diskette...or any other means.  

What about IRC?  Yes!  ICQ?  Yes!  Do you need to be paranoid 
and run out and buy the latest thing?  No.  But play it smart. 
Many home users don't make backups...but even some small  
businesses do.  By the time you discover a virus, you have no idea 
how far back your backups are infected.

I know with all this talk about viruses, someone is going to want 
me to mention NetBus again...even though it's NOT a virus.  I  
have a URL for you (NOTE: URL wraps...): 
http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/exploits-Feb-99/ 
windows.backdoors.txt

(Also check out this ISS X-Force Alert Summary: 
http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/iss/alerts/vol-3_num-5.html)

So be careful out there.  Practice safe surfing.

****************************************************************** 
Sniffers

I've received several emails from readers asking about packet 
sniffers.  Just to make sure we are on the same sheet of music, a 
'packet sniffer' is a tool that makes your ethernet adapter listen 
for and copy ALL of the frames that go by on the wire, not just the 
ones destined for that machine...or, more technically, put the  
NIC in 'promiscuous mode'.  

Now, I don't do surfing for lazy readers, but this topic got me 
curious, so I started with a search on DejaNews (notice a pattern 
here?  That's how I started when looking for info on the CIH  
virus, too).  I found an interesting app at:

ftp://ftp.lantronix.com/pub/jvsniff/jvsniff.exe

but I haven't tried it out.  I'm not going to beta test this 
one out.  I have experience using the full version of NetXRay 
from Cinco Networks (which was bought by Network Associates), 
and I found the current page for NetXRay at (URL wraps...):

http://www.nai.com/products/network_visibility/ 
network_visibility.asp

The interesting thing about NetXRay is that it's supposed to  
support PPP frames as well as ethernet frames...which means you  
could run NetXRay on your machine when dialed into the Internet. 
For those of you who aren't familiar with the subject, when you  
dial into the Internet via DUN, you are using PPP as your framing 
protocol to send and receive IP packets.  When you are on a LAN, 
you generally use ethernet (though some dinosaurs might use token 
ring).  Like I said, NetXRay is supposed to support PPP, but I 
haven't tried it yet.

Then I thought, hey, wait a minute.  NetXRay is a demo, and you 
have to buy the full version from NAI.  What about freeware or  
shareware sniffers?  Well, there aren't many for NT...though there 
are some for DOS (which may run on 95...).  Then I remembered the 
BO plug-in, BUTTSniffer, from Dildog... 

http://www.cultdeadcow.com/~dildog/BUTTSniffer/

The page for 'sniffer says that one of the future additions to  
the app will be to support PPP frames.  Cool!  

Now, supporting PPP frames doesn't mean you can sniff traffic over 
your ISPs connection.  But you can use it to troubleshoot your Perl 
or Java network apps, or see how DNS works, etc.

If anyone has a web page up that discusses and evaluates various 
sniffers for 95/98 and NT, I'd appreciate a URL!!

****************************************************************** 
Perl Corner

In this edition of the Perl Corner, I decided to present a very 
simple web server benchmark utility.  Recently at work, one of the 
engineers couldn't get a freeware benchmarking package compiled on 
Linux, so he 'rolled his own' in C.  I figured that I could do the 
same in Perl, and that's what became webbench.pl.

Now, I've only provided a very simple benchmarking script.   
Basically, a socket is created and connected to port 80 of the  
server, and the HTTP GET request is sent.  The request and the  
time to download the page (into an array) are timed, with no 
checking of file size.  

How is this a benchmarking utility?  Well, with simple additions 
and modifications to the script, you can add the 'sleep n' command, 
where 'n' is the number of seconds to pause, and you can access 
the same page every 'n' seconds.  By using the time command as well, 
and saving the output to a file, you can then run this script all 
day, and pull the data into a graphing program, such as gnuplot or 
MS Excel.  This will show you the latency of request throughout the 
day...or how long it takes the server to respond.  The response time 
will be affected by such things as overall network traffic, server 
load, etc.

Also, notice that no checking is done in the script to see if the 
proper page is returned...the server could be returning '404 Not 
Found'.  But does that matter?  I made the assumption that it  
doesn't...the server still has to process the request and return 
something.

-----  begin webbench.pl  -----

print "End time:\t$end\n"; 
print "Start time:\t$start\n"; 
print "Total time:\t$total sec\n"; 
-----  end webbench.pl  -----

That's it!  The script itself is pretty well commented, but if 
you have any questions, consult the Perl documentation (that you 
downloaded with ActivePerl if you're on 95/98/NT) or email 
me with your question.

Editor's Comments:

Okay, another one out the door!  Just to reiterate...don't ask me 
about breaking into a system, don't ask me to do your web surfing 
for you, and if you have a question, be clear.  I get a TON of email 
and anything with 'h4x0r skript' gets deleted!

Hasta!
