*** Hacker Wargame Update
==================================================================
From: Kent Davis

before I decided to start my career as a harmless hacker, I heeded your
advice to warn tech support. I was all set to take them out to dinner and
realized that the tech crew was 100 people large! I offer a far more simple
and pleasant way to inform your ISP that you'll be doing harmless hacking.
A simple phone call to tech support and informing them of what your doing,
why your doing it and that you're willing to help test your own servers
security did the trick for me! A simple explanation has also worked at
school while testing the network security there. I asked the administration
if I could test the security and before I knew it, they had me running a
windows NT webserver, Compaq proliant running Novell and a lab of 30
computers in my free time ;) A simple "Can I do this" was more than enough
for me, and is a good habit to follow.

 

[Carolyn: It depends on your ISP how much work it takes to get them on your
side.]

*** How to Block Finger
===================================================================
From: Magnus Kristiansen

Stop Finger!?!

Most Unix system uses GNU-finger daemons, which easily may be blocked 
with a .fingerrc file in your home directory, like this

----------- Cut ----------
#! /bin/sh
#
# As I don't like ppl poking around in my privacy
#
echo Please get the he*l away!
----------- Cut ----------

Don't forget to:

chmod +x .fingerrc !

*On very few systems the sysadmin has turned off the possibility to
run your own .fingerrc-scripts*

This would not work on system who doesn't use Gnu-finger...

>-------------------------------------------

This may have exploited the stupidity of the ISP's administrative person,
not Windows NT. I have tested this hack and got very different results. I
will test it further.

The above described process is still a network access and is subject to
security checks and login. Also, if it is this individual's own ISP, and he
dialed up successfully, then chances are he has an account on this machine
and was probably already logged on. Further, like in Unix, all information
that is available to the public can commonly be accessed (depending on what
is allowed by the admin) from a guest account and anybody running a LanMan
compatible networking client can wonder in and see a list of shares. For
example, if my name were Bob and I logged on as BobB to my Windows 95
computer, then tried to search the contents of a share on an NT system over
the net in the above described fashion (or any other); the NT system would
try to log me on BobB using my Windows 95 password. Failing that, it would
log me on as Guest (if the Guest account was enabled by the admin). If the
Guest account has a password, I would get a message telling me that the
share is protected by a password and be prompted for it. If not, then I am
in and allowed to view and access anything I can browse to through that
share that has been assigned rights that would permit access to Guest. If
all the share permissions use the default "Everyone Full control"
permissions and the drive is a DOS compatible format (FAT) or the local
permissions are the same as the above share, then that Admin is stupid and
thoroughly screwed no matter how you slice it. Like Novel and Unix, there
are Read/Write/delete/change permissions...etc. rights. But "Full Control"
in NT means all rights.

I have done this many times to NT machines and still not been able to cross
either the share permissions or the local permissions when I did not log on
with an account that has access to these files. No matter how you get to
the shares, if you use the regular interface on your client, you are subject
to login and file rights settings. If the file rights settings are looser
than they should be then that hole is closed by the admin viewing and
securing the access rights on those files.

Be it known that, with NT:

A>Many small ISPs use un-trained admins who do not fully understand NT
share and file rights and frequently make mistakes.

B>For ease of use, the default rights are always Everyone Full Control on
all new shares and newly formatted drives until the Admin sets it to
something else.

C>Using the FAT (DOS compatible) formatting option means that the drive is
protected by share permissions only.

Any admin reading this who is concerned about share, folder, and file
security should take a class. NT is a complex networking system comparable
in technology to Novell Netware (at least so far as file permissions are
concerned anyway). Or I can answer specific questions care of this list.

==================================================================
*** Win95 Hack
==================================================================
From: William C . Topp

I read your hh on win95. you use DOS a lot. with wfw 3.11 you could
just exit windows and be at a true DOS prompt. not so easy in win95.
this technique appeared in PC magazine Sept. 10, 1996 on p. 339. it was
in a letter from one Gary Tessler

make sure at least the following path is included in your autoexec.bat:

path c:\windows;c:\windows\command;c:\dos

edit autoexec.bat so that the last line is

win

delete or rename c:\windows\logos.sys and c:\windows\logow.sys

find c:\msdos.sys and change the attributes from hidden and read-only
edit this file with notepad to include the statement

BootGui=0 (that's zero)

in the [options] section

save the file and reset (if you want) to hidden and read-only. reboot.

what this does is cause the system to boot to DOS but the last line of
the autoexec.bat loads win95 so the effect is to boot to win95. however
when you choose "exit" from the start menu and select "shut down the
computer" boom, you're at a true DOS prompt. to get back into win95
type win

I've done this on three computers and it always works. I love it.

one small problem. you now can't hit f8 or f5 or whatever that key is
at boot time and select boot to DOS because now the autoexec.bat throws
you into windows anyway. you need to select instruction step and say
"no" to the win in autoexec.bat to actually boot to DOS.

so this lets you exit to DOS very easily but it is a pain to boot to
DOS. I favor the former, I seldom actually turn off my computer.

please note, this isn't my "hack" or whatever you call it. I got it
from the reference above.

*** More on CMOS
==================================================================

From: Gustavo Olaza

Hi,
this is the complete debug template for a password crack in PC CMOS memory.
It works invalidating the CMOS configurations <save the important parameters
before try this&gt.
The port 70h is the byte select and the port 71h is the W/R port.
First, we select the address for I/O via out port 70, address and late we
R/W via port 71.
The byte 0e is the diagnosis status byte, if the bit 5 is set the
configuration is invalid.
The bit 7 of port 70 is the NMI mask register <Never alter its value!>--------------------------------cut here-------------------------------
a 100

or al,0e
out 70,al
mov al,ff
out 71,al
ret

----------------------------cut here--------------------------------
Cut the text between the lines and paste in a text file for example cmos.txt
and in the DOS prompt at the directory where the file is in, type: DEBUG 
< CMOS.TXT; this create a file "killcmos.com". Execute this file, and when
you restart the computer you will see: "CMOS configuration invalid, please
press F1 to enter setup" or something similar.
Enjoy it. ;-)

btw...if ya know of supervisor passwords for other bioses....I would
appreciate to get them.

And at last a question....
Which protocol is used to transmit information between keyboard and

it via a normal serial port of another computer?

Correct, this kind of direct hardware access cannot be performed by a user
mode application running under NT. However a system level device driver can
(at least in theory) run low level function calls that command the OS to do
things to the HW in it's behalf. Whether or not this would allow you to
corrupt the checksum however I could not say. I do not know that, however I
would doubt it.

From: Daniel Powell

Here's a debug command that will clear part of CMOS if not all of it. Good
if your sysadmin disabled your floppy drive in BIOS. Once done, will need to
restart, You should get a check sum error on boot, which will make it load
default values. It will not clear password...on my machines anyway. I have
tried this on a Pentium 75 w/phoenix bios and a 200mmx w/award bios. and
worked both times.
Start, run, type COMMAND hit enter.
DEBUG hit enter
-o 70 2e hit enter
-o 71 ff hit enter
-q hit enter
exit hit enter
Restart the computer

*** More on Linux
==================================================================
From: Adrian Hawkins

Not to beat Linux into the ground, but I had an alternative to Aasmund
Eikli's discussion on Linux:

A man named Patrick Volkerding has put together a flavor of Slackware called
ZipSlack that simply unzips onto a Zip(tm) disk or HD. Using UMSDOS, users
don't have to mess around with partitioning their drives or buying more
hardware. It just creates a new directory. To run, the user only has to
type 'Linux' at a DOS command prompt.

This is a fully functional / upgradable spin off Slackware.

This option is great for those who would like an easy way to mess around
with Linux without losing their current Microsoft setup. ZipSlack is
available on any Slackware mirror.
----------------------------------
From: Cory Nickerson

For the many people who are asking about running Win95 Linux and other 
OS's on their computers at the same time, I'd like to suggest looking 
into a relatively new program(few months old) called master booter.
Available from download.com, the author purports it to be able to manage 
up to 6 operating systems on 6 partitions of the hard drive without the 
use of boot disks and the likes. From what I've seen, I'd recommend 
using the program in conjunction with a stand alone drive partition 
program such as partition magic. If you'd like to run more than one OS 
like me, its worth looking into(my girlfriend would kick my a** if she 
booted up to a Linux screen:P)

 

One other thing, I, like more and more people recently switched to a 
cable modem and will soon be getting a static dedicated connection 
through it and running a web/ftp and telnet server on my p166. Due to 
its unique nature and the fact that it is connected through a proxy 
server, what kind of unique security risks and concerns are there with 
this setup? Thanks.

P.S. Love the digest, just keeps getting better, tell your Wargame ISP

-----------------------------------------
From: David Ney

(Regarding Linux on same disk as Win95, with S.u.S.E.) A very simple setup
program is included (Yast). The best way to do the setup is to go to msdos
and start the setup program, make the 3 installation disks and follow the
instructions. If it is time to repartition the hard drives it's the simplest
to make 4 primary hd (hda1, hda2 ,hda3 ,hda4) all Linux partitions. I used
the first as root directory (hda1: / --->size 500MB) and (hda2: /usr
1500MB). If anything functions the best way we will come back to win95, you
have just to introduce your msdos disks in the floppy and do no format of
any hd!!!! Just exit setup and start fdisk from A:\, delete the two last
hard drives and create a new (or more) DOS partitions. Now you can restart
the computer for installing msdos. Format the hard drives, but you must pay
attention that you format "C:" and not "the first drive.." or something like
this. Now if msdos is installed start Linux, take root access and start #
yast. Now it is the best to control everything (for example if the root
drive and the usr drive is always installed right. Then you must exit and
update your system, you will come into LILO setup again, make a new entry
for example Win95 and choose start "msdos" and the hd to boot from is
/dev/hda3. Now restart your PC and if LILO is booted try with TAB the
systems which are installed. There must be Win95 and Linux start win95 (but
MS-DOS will be started) Then install your CD ROM drive and install Win 95.
If win95 works without problems you must reenter Linux with your Linux boot
disk because Win 95 writes the boot configuration on the Linux system. Now
restart yast and check everything exit it and make an update of the system
with the LILO boot program. Now when you make a restart you will get your
lilo prompt and you must enter the system you want to boot. I think this is
better like starting Linux with loadlin under windows on a DOS partition,
because it is much more stable.

From: mea culpa

>If you will let us have the source code to your joke daemons we will
credit you on our mail list

Its funny that you keep mentioning source code. I don't think you grasp
how simple it is to make daemons like that.

#!/bin/sh
TERM=vt100
trap 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

clear
echo " "
echo "in.lamerd"
echo " "
echo "If you are portscanning this machine with Strobe or a like scanner,"
echo "you should be aware that it does indeed leave all sorts of wonderful"
echo "log entries. Many lamers out there don't understand the value of a"
echo "half-open port scanner. Hell, many lamers don't even know what one"
echo "is. If you find yourself thinking 'what is one?', then please quit"
echo "scanning and worry more about learning something."
echo " "
sleep 1
exit 1

Pretty simple, no? The 'trap' command is telling it to take any input at
all and ignore it. The rest is basic shell scripting.

So, save the above as your favorite name (above is in.lamerd). Add the
following lines to the following files:

inetd.conf:
in.lamerd stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd
/usr/local/etc/in.lamerd

services:
in.lamerd 2145/tcp #

And voila. Don't forget to HUP inetd.

*** Shell Programming File Permissions
==================================================================
From: Mike Miller

chmod 777 sets permissions for all users to read, write, and execute a
file/directory (execute a directory means to change to it). chmod can be
used two ways; either with numbers or letters. The letter way is simpler,
simply type chmod <letterstring><filename>where <letterstring>includes is
the following syntax <who>+/-<what> The who field can be u g or a (for user
(the owner), group, and all). The what can be r w or x for read, write, and
execute. So to set a file to world readable, group writeable, and user
executable, you would type chmod u+rwx g+rw a+r <filename>. The number
method just uses numbers instead. The three digit code (777 in your case) is
the three permissions. The first digit is the user, then the group, then the
world. To figure out the correct number, convert to/from binary. The number
is a three digit binary number with the first ('hundreds') digit being read,
the next being write, and the last being execute. So, to use my above
example you could write it as chmod 764 <filename>. In your case, 777 sets
the directory as readable, writeable, and executable.

>and yes, Bill Gates."

I agree with the choice of hardware hack Steve Wozniak (and some of the
others, in an offhanded way) , but I think if we're talking about
"role-models" ( true purveyors of "the right thing" ) I would think that
Richard Stallman, Richard Greenblatt or anyone else that actually
CREATES would be a better philosophical role model. MIT AI lab R.I.P.

About your use of the word "hacker": 99% of your audience considers
themselves "hackers", when the real truth of the matter is, they are 
"crackers". A very fundamental difference. A "hacker" creates and
disseminates. A "pirate" steals and freely distributes stolen software
and/or data. A "cracker" gains entry to networks, and is, coincidentally,
slang for lily-white Caucasians... Irony notwithstanding. Media
journalists seem to enjoy the word "hacker", as "It strikes fear in the
hearts of High Tech CEO's" but that doesn't mean anyone should buy their
brand of ignorance...

Hmmm... Bill Gates. Bright guy, bad ideals. Almost ruined true
computing, and is the sole reason we pay for software today. (This
slightly outweighs the value of DOS) Might ought to be burned at the
stake for sending out code in binary state. "Hacker" he is NOT,
"cracker" (in the "forcibly-going-to-enter-your-network" sense, I
seriously doubt. ) Bloatware. Need I say more. Not a good choice for a
role model for today's youth. "Get really rich via seek and destroy
business motivations"...

Microsoft may be a problem, but the true evil is with Intel: Intel, NOT
MICROSOFT, have been the TRUE MONOPOLISTS. Socket 5, 6 7 are, whether
they realize it or not, are now worldwide standards, in which they still
charge other makers of semiconductors a hefty licensing fee for every
chip sold. Semiconductor Mafioso. That is a monopoly. Bundling a browser
with an OS, is like telling auto manufacturers they can't include a
stereo in their new cars, as it would be unfair trade practices to other
car stereo manufacturers. Netscape is losing, and they don't seem to be
taking it very well... They lost focus, and started telling users what
they would get, as opposed to listening to what they want. Microsoft
listened. They win. The Intel would-be AMD/CYRIX/Centaur Technologies
killer, the Pentium II, is simply a Pentium Pro (lots of L2 cache on the
back end) in a different socket. Zero performance gain with the new
socket, but certainly an efficient way to attempt to kill the
competition and produce a new marketing campaign, all in one nifty
package. Might want to enlighten your readers. Microsoft bashing, at
this point, is just a sign of ignorance and immaturity... besides, they
are better as a marketing firm than a software vendor... Anyone who's
viewed "the blue screen of death" in NT can attest to that...

I freely admit I use high-end Intel-based systems when I design (I'd
love an SGI Octane, but I'd prefer to feed and clothe my wife and
daughters), as I have neither the time, nor the inclination to recreate
the Adobe (and others) software I utilize on the Intel platform for
other platforms. Not Logical. That doesn't mean for one moment that I
don't support the Free Software Foundation and the CopyLeft ideals: I'm
creating (still working) on a multitrack audio recording system for the
Linux/unix X11 platform, to give to the world FREE. (Not trying to sound
self-righteous) Why don't you teach your subscribers/students about FSF?
(http://www.fsf.org) It's free. Get them unhooked from being addicted to
Microsoft dumbed-down OS's... "Hacking on Windows 95/98".... Pretty
funny, in that it's quite the oxymoron... big deal... "telnet".... That,
I suspect, is the biggest problem today with our computing youth, in
that everyone wants their "warez", and no one wants to think for
themselves...

The defense is not to save your password at the YAHOO news ticker prompt.
