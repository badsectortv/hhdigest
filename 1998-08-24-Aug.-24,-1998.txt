 *** WordPad wonders 
================================================================== 
From: <NoTrace1@aol.com>

What's up everyone this is No Trace. I was copying text info from the net 
and pasting it into the windows program Wordpad. I was thinking to myself 
how would Windows handle it if I tried to paste other things in Wordpad like 
a program, files or a shortcut. I found out some very interesting things 
that could easily make Wordpad a security risk for people who don't want you 
running certain things. Here's what you can do and how this works. You can 
copy and paste an exe in Wordpad but the exe must only need the exe to run 
it - no dlls or other files can be needed.  You only have room for 1 object 
in here, meaning the exe or whatever you are pasting.  Once it's pasted you 
can run the program like normal FROM WORDPAD! What is does is it will write 
the whole file into Wordpad. You can save it and the doc file you saved will 
be as big as the program file is.  If you want to run a program that 
requires other files to get it running you can create a shorcut to the 
program you want to run and copy that, then paste it into Wordpad and run it 
from the shorcut.  Also you can paste any type of file that will run from 
it's extention (like a pic), or you can paste a doc file into Wordpad and 
double click that and it will open a new Wordpad window with the doc!

There are many implications of what this can be used for. For people that 
want to hide there files or exe's, put them in Wordpad. hehe. 
No Anti-Virus progam is worried about Wordpad doc's; no administrator 
cares about some Wordpad doc on his computer when it comes to security.  If 
you are on a Windows system that gives users different rights and cannot 
access other programs, you can hopefully find the computer running on root 
one day in your office lets say and copy a shortcut to Wordpad then save it 
before the boss or whoever comes back. Then run Wordpad because all users 
can run Wordpad and open it.

Note: I'm not sure if that will work it depends on what your running and the 
security it has but most of the time you can run shortcuts to areas you are 
not supposed to have rights to. They just usually won't give you the 
shorcuts when you log onto your account but your lovely, well hidden Wordpad 
doc has the shortcut you need. For all you people trying to hide your 
programs that people download you might be able to make a program that can 
open up the doc with your exe and double-click it without you physically 
doing it.

Also this shows up in your task manager when you press ctrl-alt-del; it 
usually runs two programs one called packager and the other is your exe and 
I think it gives it different names depending on what you have running but 
it usually starts with PKG.  There are more implications I am sure, you just 
have to find them. Who would have thought WORDPAD.  My favorite thing about 
this is that nobody in security cares or even thinks about Wordpad when it 
comes to security.

Play nice. 
Peace

[Dale: If you want to learn more about how and why this works, read up on 
topics like Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), Component Object Model 
(COM), and Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). 
Actually, WordPad is usually considered by serious security people, as are 
all other apps that support these features. The problem is that many people 
require this functionality to do their daily work. Practical Security is a 
trade off between the need to be secure and the need to do your work...]

 *** NAV removes Back Orifice 
=================================================================== 
From: "Ted Al Groans" <groans@mailexcite.com>

Hi!

There was a letter in one of the August 10 publication of HH describing how 
to detect the Back Orifice trojan.  The writer describes a way of deleting 
it from the registry.  This is just to inform everyone, that if you have 
Norton Antivirus, if you update it, it should detect it on your system.  In 
fact I tried to download a zip file containing it, and it gave me warnings. 
It is not a bad idea to check the registry anyway, but the NAV approach is 
an easy deal.

 *** Using JAVA to deliver BO 
================================================================== 
From: Nelson Murilo <nelson@pangeia.com.br>

JSA                                   Finjan 
                          Monday, August 17, 1998 
  
                     Back Orifice Hostile Applet Alert 
  
A hostile Java applet that contains the widely publicized hacker tool 
called "Back Orifice" has been discovered on a Java consulting firm's 
WebSite. Back Orifice was designed as an application by the hacker group, 
Cult of the Dead Cow, and was debuted last week at the Def Con hacker 
conference. This application can remotely monitor and control Windows 95 
and Windows 98 systems. It also has the power to add and delete files, 
directories and registry entries. 
  
The interesting twist to the Back Orifice application came recently when 
it was embedded in a Java applet and dynamically installed in the browser 
environment. While this was only a "demonstration applet," it did point 
out the growing trend of taking public domain code and changing the code 
to create a different type of attack or delivery method. This trend makes 
it virtually impossible for a security administrator to maintain adequate 
levels of protection -- the many mutations of public code can be endless. 
This is a growing trend on the Internet today, where there are "how to 
hack" sites popping up with everything from how to build denial of service 
attacks to stolen digital certificates from respected software companies. 
The most recent well-known attack using exploited public code was the 
Pentagon "teardrop" attack. 
  
Throughout the last 10 days, many well-publicized security holes in 
Microsoft environments, Netscape and Eudora mail have been brought to 
light. Many of these problems are made more serious when combined with 
mobile code payloads. Buffer overflow problems are only really serious if 
the code delivered in the payload does something nasty. The upshot is that 
mobile code can be used to successfully attack and compromise many popular 
computing environments. Pervasive mobile code systems, especially 
JavaScript and ActiveX, make exploitation of subtle security holes much easier. 
  
Dr. Gary McGraw, co-author of the forthcoming book, "Securing Java: 
Getting down to business with mobile code," and Vice President of Reliable 
Software Technologies, http://www.rstcorp.com, offers this perspective: 
  
"Mobile code poses a real threat to any computing environment. One way to 
lessen your security exposure is to manage mobile code extremely 
carefully. New features in Java can help you do this when used wisely. 
Bringing this point even closer to home is the fact that the hacker tool 
called Back Orifice, which completely compromises Windows platforms, can 
now be installed using mobile code."

Back Orifice Applet Delivery Details: 
    1. Although this is a demonstration only, this applet's technique can 
       very easily be revised by others with malicious intent to incur 
       significant damage to your computers and environment. 
    2. The applet is signed and "trusted" with a digital signature, yet 
       it can still do damage. While digital signatures are an important 
       part of your security model, most security breaches are 
       nonetheless still carried out by trusted sources. Plus, fraudulent 
       digital signature certificates are already easily available from 
       several hacker sites. Security solutions that rely on digital 
       signature checking alone will not be effective against this applet 
       injecting Back Orifice, or against other versions of this attack. 
    3. Those of you with Finjan mobile code security in place are 
       protected in this case. SurfinShield and SurfinGate solutions 
       block this type of applet.

We will continue to update our customers and partners about additional 
malicious mobile code. Please be sure to check Finjan's Web site for the 
latest information on security breaches. To reduce chances of applet 
proliferation, we are not including a link to the applet at this time. For 
further information on the nature of Back Orifice in general, please see

 *** Trojan Horses 
================================================================== 
From: Bios <klougee@forcomm.net>

Well, to me you guys are late on info about trojan horses.  I know of 3 
(4 including BO) trojan horses that are all over IRC.

1. EvilFTP, this trojan is pretty good.  I know, I am the one that brought 
it to IRC. When the program which provides the back door is run (the progam 
that provides the back door acts like a FTP server),  then anyone can 
connect and upload, download etc. 
2. Hackers Pardise, this trojan works like evilFTP but does not act like a 
FTP server.  In fact this trojan works just like BO but does not have as 
many options. 
3. Masters Pardise, this trojan works just like Hackers Pardise and BO but 
has less options than BO.

Well, just maybe the author got the idea of making BO from evilFTP, 
Hackers Pardise or Masters Pardise.  Many many so called "lamerz" on IRC 
want these program and thats why I regret bringing evilFTP to IRC.  Well 
thats all, thank you.

 *** CCMaker File on the Net 
================================================================== 
From: lovespirit2@juno.com

========================================================= 
Ccmaker.exe posted on Newsgroups: Beware!!! This file does some wicked stuff! 
=========================================================

In July, some cracker or someone who wanted to be mean, posted a file 
called Credit Card maker; it is ccmaker.exe and is 24 KB in size.  If 
you run it, it begins a time bomb countdown threatening to erase your 
hard drive.  I did it, but shut off the computer and scanned the entire 
HD.  I was lucky, but don't really know if this program will truly erase 
the entire HD or destroy your computer.  Email me privately for a copy of 
the gizmo, they thought was funny.

Opening a text editor on it reveals some fascinating stuff.

lovespirit2@juno.com

[Dale: It *probably* is nothing more than a joke - run it on a machine 
that has nothing on it and watch it run to completion... I've never seen it 
myself, but that is my guess.]

================================================================= 
 *** NetBus 
================================================================= 
From: anonymous

Another tool which came out concurrently and with similar functionality 
to Back Orifice is called NetBus. It runs on Windows NT, unlike 
Back Orifice, so is of concern to Windows NT administrators. NetBus 
functions in much the same way as Back Orifice in that it is a 
client-server program. The server portion is installed on the 
victim's computer, and the client can then "control" the server. 
Understand that this is a back door tool, and thus can't be used 
to attack NT hosts right up front. Like Back Orifice, it must be 
installed once someone has access to NT. It's probably more dangerous 
overall than Back Orifice because the latter gives access only to 
lower-end systems (Windows 9x systems) with more limited execution environments.

NetBus has the following characteristics: 
* Size is about 500k (vs 128K for Back Orifice) 
* Hides itself as "SysEdit" in the process table 
* Installs a DLL called KeyHook.dll 
* Has command line switch to SysEdit that will modify registry to run 
  it each time the system starts 
* Can scan IP-numbers for computers running NetBus.

 *** IRC program question 
================================================================== 
From: Raymond Cline <Rodan2@erols.com>

I have a question. I use IRC via MIRC 5.4 and while online the other 
night in a chatroom, I was having a private conversation with another 
person from the channel. I know nothing is private in IRC, but we were 
talking about this guy who was online in the chatroom. He was not aware 
of the conversation we were having about him, (or so I thought) till he 
messaged me VIA DCC and asked me if I wanted to know anything about him 
I should ask him directly. He told me he knew that I was in private chat 
with this other person and he was watching us type about him?? What I 
want to know is this guy full of B.S. or can he really do this?? He even 
told me ver-batim what we were saying.. I was just so stunned.... and 
embarrased to.. So I told him I was sorry and directed my questions to 
him directly. The person I was talking to told me he was just guessing? 
But not if he told me exactally what I was typing. I would appreciate 
your input here.

 *** Windows telnet question 
================================================================== 
From: Batman <dabatman@yahoo.com>

I was reading the HH email discussions and it said send Win ?'s to 
you. So here goes:

When I telnet to my ISP's port 22, i get this:

SSH-1.5-1.2.20

I'm sure it has something to with secure shell but anything I try to type 
in always gives the message:

Protocol mismatch.

and then it disconnects.

I would really appreciate any help you can provide.

Batman **(^)**

[Carolyn:  That is secure shell, a program that provides an encrypted 
version of telnet.  I use Secure Shell religiously, with a program I got 
from http://www.datafellows.com.]

 *** Re Mac Question 
================================================================= 
From: <ZehrWang@aol.com>

Re Mac Question:In responce to the mac question,

Its very easy to make files not seen on your computer. Get the freeware 
program called ResEdit, then open it up goto the file menu then there's a 
thing like file prefs. Open that up and click on File Invisable button. If 
someone did a find for it they would pick it up, so don't name it like 
"MYPASSWORDDONTLOOK" or something.... 
------------------------------------------ 
From: Strider <Strider@baka.com>

Caleb, 
There are a number of utilities that will do the job- Resedit, The Cloak, 
and even MacPERL will do it for you. Each has a number of uses, but if you 
_only_ want to make files invisible, The Cloak is what you'll want to use.

It's available at <ftp://ftp.euro.net/Mac/info-mac/disk/cloak-10.hqx>.

From: Evil Ninja Taoist <mulder@ntplx.net>

Invisible folders, like most other things, are easy to do on a 
Macintosh. My recommendation is do it the easy way; do a net search and 
find Big Secret, a nifty little Invisible files application...It'll let you 
create invisible folders and invisible specific files, it's password 
protected, and no one should be the wiser. Try selecting the app, going 
into get info, and changing it's icon into a word file or something really 
generic and entitling it "English #1" or something stupid like that; no one 
will even know it's there.

From: Dragon John <wizard@bga.com>

The most universal way of doing this would be to get the file's info using 
ResEdit (available from apple for free).  Then check the 'invisible' box. 
That's it.  You won't be able to access the file from the desktop anymore, 
until you unset the invisible flag.

From: "QuikSilver" <quiksilr@ComCAT.COM>

In reply to the question about making files/folders invisible on a mac there 
are many ways to go about doing this but I found the best way is to use a 
program called DiskTop.  It is very small but really lets a serious mac user 
take control over his system.  Do a search for Disktop to find it.  It is 
made by PrairieSoft Inc.  If you do any mac hacking you probably use 
ResEdit.  You can also make files hidden using that.  Hope this helped.

From: Somnambulist <kunst@hooked.net>

Caleb,

In order to do this, you will need one of the most essential pieces of 
software any Mac owner can have.

ftp://ftp.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/US/Macintosh/U 
tilities/ResEdit_2.1.3.sea.bin

From ResEdit's file menu select Get File/Folder Info, and then search for 
the folder containing the dirty .jpegs that you want to hide. In the "Info 
for..." box that comes up, click the check box next to invisible.

Undoing it is just as simple, you just uncheck the box next to 
invisible :)

You could also use Snitch to do the same thing, but using ResEdit is more 
respectable. You will need to use Apple-F to access the files within that 
folder.

ResEdit URLs:

(I know that's cheap, but I need to go home now.) 
------------------------------------------ 
From: Anthony Tobias Teel <bigtoe@hardlink.com>

To make files invisible on a mac, you must get an attribute editor for the 
mac.  ResEdit has one built in.  You can get it from ftp.apple.com.  Also 
if you have Norton utilities, the fast find utility also has an attribute 
editor. This is will also help you in correcting the owners of files (what 
programs open them) and their file types. 
  
I must also warn you that hiding files is a pain on a mac.  In order to 
unhide them you have to run resedit, or another attribute editor, making 
it a pain.  On the pc, it's easy to work with hidden directories, on a mac 
it's significantly more difficult.

If you want to, a great way to make your files hidden is to make disk 
images of them.  They're easy to access, they're on your hard drive, and 
the disk copy application you need to do this is free (also from 
apple.com).  I believe you can password protect them too.  You could 
probably do this with stuffit archives, but disk images are easier to work 
with in my opinion.

Ahh well.

 *** Editorial - Too Lame??? 
================================================================== 
From: Dale Holmes <editor@techbroker.com>

Several people write me each week complaining that the Happy Hacker Digest 
is too lame. They say that the technical level of the articles in the HHD is 
so low that the Digest is of little use to them. I thought seriously about 
it, and decided that - to a certain extent, they are right.

Many of the articles in the HHD cater to the hacking newbie. Given that, it 
is logical that the articles would then be relatively simple to someone who 
has vast technical knowledge and experience. Many of these articles in one 
place could make a publication dull or of little use to a long time hacker.

SO WHAT!!! There are many, many newbie hackers out there - and they need 
help. They need a place where they can learn without being chastised because 
they are new and don't already know everything. The HHD is a place for them. 
If a person does not find the information useful - there is no obligation 
for them to continue to subscribe.

And another thing - the articles in the HHD are submitted by it's readers. 
If you consider yourself technically proficient in an area that is not being 
addressed by the digest, write an article and send it in! I will be glad to 
print it. Remember, though, that many of the readers will still be looking 
for articles that are easier for them to understand, and those articles will 
continue to get printed.

I personally would love to see the HHD running a whole range of articles at 
various levels of technical difficulty. This would help to provide some 
growth for long time readers. I'd like the HHD to be a useful publication 
for newbies and experts, and everyone in between, but it is not up to me... 
It is the readers that make this publication what it is.

If you write to me complaining that the publication is too lame, you only 
have yourself to blame for not contributing an article that you feel is 
worthwhile. If you are lurking out there, reading every issue and not 
submitting any articles, don't complain if you don't see what you want - 
write something up and send it in, and encourage your peers to do the same. 
I'm waiting...
