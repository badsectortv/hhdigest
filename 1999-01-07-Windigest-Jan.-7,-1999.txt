Okay, to get the ball rolling here...let me start by answering one 
of the big questions I have received via email.  Yes, you can, in 
fact, "hack" from Windows...even 95!!  In fact, there is very little 
that you can't do from 95 or NT, if you have the right resources 
available.  In future digests, I will be addressing this exact 
issue...but for now, start by checking out the link to the PC  
Magazine Free Utilities link I have in the next section...

Editor's Comments:  For anyone who has been following the two 
sites above, it would seem as though there is some sort of  
underground hacker war going on.  Groups like HcV, milw0rm, 
and now the 109 Security Team seem to be hacking web sites just 
to publicize their disdain for each other.  Add to this LOU's  
"declaration of war" (not my words) on China and Iraq for  
civil rights abuses (and the subsequent statements by other  
groups such as 2600, CdC, l0pht, and Phrack condemning such 
actions), and the US Dept. Of Defense's decision to _finally_ 
view cyberspace as a valid battlefield...sheesh.  Is it safe 
to web surf anymore!?!?

April Fool's 2001 Bug 
Richard Smith <rms@PHARLAP.COM> of PharLap sent in a bug report to 
Microsoft on 5 Jan 99 that was confirmed the next day, but no  
mention was given as to a fix.  The bug is as follows:

In the US and Canada, daylight savings starts on the first Sunday 
in April and runs until the last Sunday in October.  For more on 
this see: 
http://www.energy.ca.gov/daylightsaving.html

It seems, however, that Microsoft's runtime library, specifically 
MSVCRT.DLL, thinks that in the year 2001, daylight savings doesn't 
start until April 8...when in fact, it starts on April 1.  So for 
a week, the system clocks will be out of sync by an hour.

Richard has a test demo page at: 
http://security.pharlap.com/y2k/demo1.htm

Thanks, Rich!!

Clearing Browser History: Update 
With new web browser versions coming out faster than the justice 
department can say "patent infringement", Carolyn's papers on how to 
prevent people at work or home from snooping around in your page  
history have gone out of date fairly rapidly. That's why I'm here to  
update some of that information.

The best way to prevent people from knowing the web pages you've been 
visiting is to delete your browser's page history.

Page history Netscape's Navigator browser versions 4.x can be deleted 
by:

1.       In a Navigator window, open the Communicator menu.

2.       Open the Tools menu.

3.       Click History

4.       a) To delete all entries press down CTRL and A on your  
keyboard and then the Delete button.

         b) To delete a specific entry click on it and press Delete 
on your keyboard

Internet Explorer 4 and above also let you remove browser history 
easily. To clear it out completely follow these steps:

1.       In an Internet Explorer window, slide down the View menu

2.       Choose Internet Options

3.       Click the Clear History button

To delete specific entries in Internet Explorer's history follow these 
steps:

1.       In an Internet Explorer windows, click the History button

2.       Right-click on an entry

3.       Choose Delete from the context menu

Changing your Active Desktop View  
I received an email from AMOX <amox@ver1.telmex.net.mx>, a reader 
from Mexico.  He sent me an interesting technique for changing the 
look of your system if you are using Active Desktop.  I'll be  
translating here...this pertains to changing the way the Options/ 
View as a Web Page looks.  I can't test this, as I don't have 
Active ("Captive") Desktop, but I'm putting it out there for  
the glorious readers to try!!

First, there are some hidden ".htt" files that contain the template 
for how Explorer is supposed to look when viewed as a web page. 
Amox reports that there is a good deal of documentation in these  
files, so no exact step-by-step guide was passed on.  He also says 
that there are two files, wvleft.mbp and wvline.gif, that are the 
graphics for the left panel and menubar line, respectively.  Change 
these to whatever you like...

Like I said, I haven't been able to test this.  If anyone has a  
step-by-step guide for this that they want to share, send it along. 
Credit and kudos go to Amox!!

ICQRevenge Trojan Update 
wh0re <wh0re@SoftHome.net> 
Below i have included what Yruno wrote about this trojan. I read about 
something that sounds related on some security site. It said that lots 
and lots of boxes (in the thousands) were continuously  
downloading/requesting files from certain websites. Of course this is  
sucking the hell out of their bandwidth, and slowing geocities  
wayyyyyy down. It was believed that people were downloading trojans  
that continuously requested/downloaded certain files. Just thought i  
would let ya know!  
P.S. I wouldn't mind a strip poker game with Jenny McArthy either!!!!

From: <yruno2@usa.net> 

Hi again Carolyn, 

Seems I have stumbled upon another almost identical trojan horse like 
the icqrevenge I wrote about before.  I don't know a lot about this  
one yet, and it is still active.  The file is called jm-poker.zip,  
called "Jenny McCarthy strip-poker" (a friend got it, not me... I  
swear!) The program file which is installed is called OCE.EXE.  This  
one also connects to the irc, and logs you into a channel, and it is  
a bit more sophisticated than icqrevenge (although written in VB).   
It also downloads files from a geocities account, which I haven't  
determined what their use is yet. 

Anyway, wanted to give a heads-up, and warn you users in case they  
were looking to play some poker with Jenny one time, they probably  
have this running on their machine, and are vulnerable to snooping.   
I would assume this one also installs in the auto-run section of the  
registry, so search for oce.exe and delete the key. 

I'll send more info as soon as I dig it out.

**Editor's Comments:  Sheesh, where do you guys come up with your 
nick's??  Anyway, on the subject of trojans...anytime you are  
running just ANY program you get off of the Internet, you are  
vulnerable to this.  A company in Australia scanned some ISPs down 
there and found over 1400 running copies of BO!!  And that's only 
the ones that weren't reconfigured to run on something other than the 
default port.  So what do you do?  Well, don't run arbitrary programs 
that you get on the Net.  Some of the more popular ways of getting 
users to execute these programs the first time are to either rename 
the file to something "kewl" ("hotbabes.exe", "naked.exe") or to 
attach it to another program, such as any of these animation .exes 
you see around Christmas time.

Adding Features To Your Windows Box...FOR FREE

A lot of folks (users, newbies, sysadmins, etc) don't  
realize how easy it is to add features to their Win95/98/NT 
boxen.  And it is very, very easy...it's only limited by  
your imagination.

What I've included below is a list of sites that provide 
the means of adding features to your system...FOR FREE. 
I was able to gather this list in a matter of minutes, and 
it is by no means complete...but it is enough to show you 
that there are a lot of available resources.

My particular favorite is Perl for Win32.  It's great... 
flexible, easy to use, and free.  Don't know how to program? 
No problem...there are lots of tutorials available?  Don't 
have any money?  No problem...it's free.  What can you do 
with it?  A LOT!!  Not only can you write Perl and CGI scripts, 
but you can write scripts that use any of the command line tools 
on your system...nbtstat.exe, net.exe, etc.  You can write port 
scanning tools that look for and catalog hosts that have 
NetBus loaded, and you can write an NT service (yes, a 
"service"...you can use a Resource Kit utility to install any 
script as a service) that makes your system look like it's 
running NetBus, but logs the IP of the user who is trying to 
connect.  You can even write your own finger server!  Further, 
ActiveState's Perl has a tool for creating an executable out of 
your script.  Incidently, this is also true for Python, which has 
a "freeze" utility for creating executables that you can share 
with your friends!

My second favorite is Java.  Now, you've probably heard folks 
say that Java is lame...but check the classified ads of a paper 
in a large city, or any employment web site.  Do a search on 
all companies that want Java developers.  Java is free, too, 
and you can use it to write applets for web pages, or  
applications (applications don't use a browser).  Want to 
write your own email tool or encrypted chat program?  It's 
easy to do in Java...

I've also included links for a free (GNU) C compiler, Lisp, 
and a couple of interesting alternative operating systems. 
Lisp is a programming language that is used in artificial 
intelligence research and implementation.  I've played with 
Inferno...it installs right alongside NT, and it's a lot of 
fun to play with.  The Cygnus C compiler provides a nice  
bash shell, so you can learn bash shell programming without 
having to have Linux installed on your system. 

If you're interested in other programming languages, such as 
Ada or Prolog, start at the Yahoo web site, choose the 
Computers and Internet section, and then the Programming  
Languages subsection.  

This is a list of sites that offer the ability to add a  
wide variety of features to your system...servers, clients, 
scripting and programming languages, etc.

Editor's Note:  Okay, cherished readers, there's a new editor 
on the block!  And I would just like to ask you for your help, 
so that we may help you better.  Many of the emails I receive 
are just plain unclear...there isn't enough information in  
the email to answer the question.  Given the volume of email, 
it's always possible that one or two will slip through the  
cracks.  So here's some tips that will help us help you:

1.  Be clear.  Tell us what you want.   
2.  Give enough back ground information to help...what operating 
system, application, or command you were using.  The more detail 
the better...as long as the detail pertains to the question. 
3.  Stay away from 'lee7 skript...it's too difficult to understand. 
4.  Try to use complete sentences and grammar.  The easier it is 
for us to understand you, the quicker we can address your concerns. 
5.  Spelling...'nuff said!

If anyone has any ideas for a topic for the Digest or even a Guide, 
send it along.  Credit will be given, of course...the majority of  
the Digest will always come from the readers.  Every now and again, 
expect me to add comments, or little sections on things I have been 
working on.
