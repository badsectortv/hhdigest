*** PGP

"clout" wrote about difficulties in using PGP.

If you have got it from a proper source , it will have loads of docs with 
it.

read with t.com, list.com, or even dos type | more >prn 
I NEVER USE MS WORD TO OPEN AND READ ANY STRANGE DOCS, I USE SHAREWARE TEXT 
READER (associate, t.com, or list.com) This cannot be infected by macro 
viruses !

first: 
cd\pgp262 
pgp -h   > prn or printscreen, or pencil and paper notes if no printer! 
this command (note the minus, you use it before anything....) gives you a 
list of the commands. Just print it out and nail it to the wall above the PC. 
Its always the form;

PGP space -(minus sign) space some letter(s) space  some file name. some 
users public key If I want to send a text document, atomicb.txt to AliceA, 
assuming I have AliceA's PGP public key on my Pubring.pgp:

Let us pretend, a la hollywood, that in a small text file, all the 
information for a DIY a A-bomb can be found!!!!!

<pgp -ea atomicb.txt AliceA >

and it will encrypt  the -e bit, and also turn it into an ascii text 
(better than mime, uuencode etc, the -a bit.

I just send the resultant atomicb.asc file by e-mail to Alice. 
She uses the DOS/Windoze file manager MOVE it to her pgp262 directory from 
\...\ download, or Select|Edit|copy... EDIT|Paste.

She types "pgp -d atomicb.asc" . It should look up her private key in her 
secring.pgp and decrypt it.

If it doesn;t she needs to edit with a plain text editor, I use e88.com, 
but any will do the set up text file which tells pgp where all the files 
are.

If it is a shared PC, her secring.pgp file will be on a floppy. It will ask 
for her pass phrase, use a long one like "zephod beetlebrox 4 prisedent", 
using a few mispellings. I use Hebrew /Welsh/English Torah Texts using a 
Welsh Bible/ a KJ version and a normal Hebrew version. The priestly 
blessing or the Shema are examples of what I used . It avoids any attack 
using any transalation, as I mix languages on a line to line basis. 
."Oi hate skule" would also defeat a dictionary attack ![I hate school] I'm 
an IT lecturer!

If she supples the correct pass phrase, it will decrypt the message for 
her.

She then goes to the local chemist and orders a few kg of plutonium, some 
plastic explosive etc...................or so the cheap spy stories go ! 
You need a 486 dx33 and this takes 3.5 mins to produce your own 1024 digit 
pgp key pair.

pgp -kg  is the command.

To make it work as fast as above use Ramdrive .sys and do all your 
calculations on the imaginary E drive. It gets rid of anything that could 
be used to break the keys, and works faster. You can of course hide the 
secring.pgp be remaning it to a genuine , not often used dos file; 
copy C:\pgp262 secring.pgp C:\dos\exe2bin.exe, and its unlikley that it 
would be found easily. You just rename it back for each use. 
Don't use less than a 1024 digit key, and use a long, miss-spalt paz fraze 
2 buger urp snooprz.

pgp -kxa MikeO mykey.txt will extract your public key to a text file from 
the public key ring to a file, call it mykey.txt that can be sent by 
e-mail, quite openly, as the public key is of no use in decrypting the 
file, only the secret key pair can do this. PGP is easy to break in theory. 
If you used a 2 digit key you could do it with a calculator, but to find 
the two prime numbers that are multiplied together to make the 1024 digit 
key, though simple in theory, just takes too long for a practical parallel 
array of 10,000 pentium pro's to do in the lifetime of the NSA, or  INTEL. 
The risks with pgp are :

        1/ your private/secret key gets copied. Passphrase compromised. 
  
 2/ You cannot be sure of whom you are actually exchanging keys 
 with. i helped a journalist set up comms with a retired kgb 2 star 
 general, but he could have been with a CIA spook pretending to be a kgb 
 man, there is no way of telling. 
  
 3/ Tempest, e/m emissions from the screen,(1/4 mile away) or bugs 
 near/in the pc that display the plain text. 
  
 4/ your friend works for the KGB/CIA/NSA, and shares your PC. 
  
 5/ Someone has fitted a hard card into your PC that copies all your 
 work. 
  
 6/ You have got a castrated version of PGP via the KGB/CIA thats 
 full of security holes, but still has Phil 's notes and docs with it! 
  
 7/ By error you sent the plain text by e-mail to Alice...... 
 atomicb.txt rather than atomicb.asc ! 
  
 8/ You loose your secret and or private key... no way back, the 
 next pair you generate will be different ! 
  
 9/ The spooks steal your PC and all your disks, and eventually find 
 your secret key ring. 
  
 10/ If you send pgp encrypted messages to Abu.Nidal@ terror.net in 
 Damascus,  Mossad, while not being able to read their content, might 
 pay you a not too friendly visit ! Traffic analisys !!!!!

There are free PGP dos and Windoze front ends, I have used them, and given 
them up. I have been using PGP for 5 years now. 
I get pgp by ftp from www.ifi.uio.no/pgp 
ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi/pc/.... pgp262.zip is another source. 
If you have e-mail you can use FTP See Dr Bobs Guide to accessing the net 
by e-mail (Tour-bus e-mail list) 
don't try to get it from USA if you live outside the uSA, its classed as 
munitions, and you will get done for it, use any of the various mirror 
sites 
abroad, norway, finland etc, and its on many shareware collections/cd's but 
you need version 2.6.2, this is the de facto web standard.

  Take a trip down to your local book store and see if you can find a 
copy of _The Official PGP User's Guide_ ©1995 Philip Zimmermann.  It 
should be in the computer section(a given, eh?), it's got a tan cover 
and it's not too thick. It's got every thing from the t-files that came 
with the prog., just organised into a much more easly readable format. 
I don't know what it is about having a hard copy form, but it helps me 
out. 
  The copy that I have is for 2.6, not 2.6.2, but I think it's updated 
with every release any ways.  If they don't have it, just ask for them 
to order ya a coppy.

*** FoolProof 
From: "Michael Todd" <trelane@infocom.com> 
=============================================================================

This is in reference to the Win95 questions. I've never seen the program 
FoolProof but I have some tips that might help. First, I assume that it 
loads at startup through some type of password reference or might just load 
in windows startup. A couple of ways to find out are

1.  Hit F8 during boot and go to Safe Mode Command Prompt. Edit the 
Autoexec.bat and see what is loading there. If not there, go to 
Windows\Startm~1\Programs\Startup and see what is loading there. Should 
have .LNK extenstion. Might be there. If so, simply holding down the shift 
key while 95 boots will cause all things in the startup folder not to 
start. There's a couple of others. Go to the Windows directory and edit the 
system.ini and win.ini and see if it's listed in there. win.ini will have a 
couple of lines that say load= and run=. See if it's in there. For all 
this, you will need to get to DOS. The only protection that DOS has is the 
attrib. If a file is hidden, system, read-only, the way to unprotect that 
is to type :  ATTRIB filename.ext -h -s -r  (where filename is name of file 
and ext is the extension, like win.ini ) That pretty much takes care of DOS 
security.

2. More than likely, if it's a decent program at all, it is booting in the 
Windows registry. If so, things will be a little harder, but you can edit 
the registry in Safe Mode. Be sure to back up the registry files which are 
system.dat, system.da0, user.dat and user.da0. I think those are the only 
ones, correct me if I'm wrong. You may want to export the registry to a 
diskette, in case you screw it up badly and Windoze doesn't load. In case 
you haven't worked with the Registry any, here's some basic steps. 
a. Click start, go to run and type in regedit. 
b. Click registry on the menu (first one, top left) then export that bad boy to 
a disk or somewhere. You'll need it if you screw up. If you mess it 
up, you can import it using similar steps. 
c. Click edit then go to Find and type in the name of the string. You're 
probably looking for FoolProof. You can check for later occurances of it by 
pressing F3. Once you've found it, just click on it and hit the delete key. 
By the way, doing that removes it forever until it is reinstalled and may 
cause other problems. If so, import the registry back for a un-noticible 
hack.

3. Another way to get rid of annoying passwords and things are to go to DOS 
again (gotta love DOS) and go to Windows directory and move (don't delete, 
you'll need them later) all files with the extension .pwl. Then go to the 
Windows\System directory and move password.cpl to a diskette or another 
directory. That pretty much gets rid of all password files that Windows has 
access to. Screensavers and log ins included.

Enjoy and remember that if you do this on a computer that is not your own, 
you will get in trouble if you are caught. Doing the above things takes 
some time to do. Good luck.

My gawd.... Win95 sekurity sux!!!!

        Sometimes, F8 is protected (i protect in my office... and i am 
the only hax0r here that is able to bypass that... ;>). If that's your case, 
there is another way around for that:

        well, here it goes.... Boot with a floppy... then u will have 
all the access u need. Oh... U can't boot with the floppy???? Change that in 
the CMOS (u know how to get there, don't u?).

        Ops... the CMOS is requesting a password. Well, that will 
require some hardware knowledge... let's c if i can help...

- open the computer (don't care how u will do it) 
- beside the battery, there is a jumper. Just remove the jumper from 
there, turn on the computer and then turn off again... place the jumper 
and you are done. This way around will work in almost all the computers 
i know. Even those COMPAQ's! Just be carefull doint that in a PS/2 or 
any other IBM (you all can't imagine how i hate IBM).

After that, u know what to do, right?

*** VanHacking Mac Hacking Contest 
From: bhootnath@juno.com (Niraj Bhatt) 
============================================================================= 
 

     $10,000 MACINTOSH WEB SERVER SECURITY CHALLENGE 
  
     From today, June 01 to July 15, 1997, VirTech Communications 
     Inc. [ http://www.virtech-ca.com ] will challenge the global 
     hacker community to bypass the security of its Macintosh World 
     Wide Web server. Similar contests have been conducted 
     previously in the US and Sweden, but VirTech's challenge is 
     unique in that it addresses popular Internet security issues 
     that are plaguing the media today. By launching the challenge, 
     VirTech wants to overturn the notion that the Internet is 
     vulnerable to credit card number snatching. Additionally, 
     VirTech also wants to prove its server can withstand the type of 
     vandalism attacks that have been successfully directed 
     against the NASA and CIA Web servers.

     The rules are simple and the prize is big. Whoever breaks 
     into the server, snatches the credit card number, and 
     changes the phrase found on the page will win a hefty CAD 
     $10,000 or an equivalent of US$7,500 prize. The credit card 
     number will have an extra four digits appended to it in 
     order to verify that the credit card number has indeed been 
     snatched from the challenge page. Moreover, there will be a 
     special phrase in the page that a challenger must change to 
     claim the prize. The phrase could be something like "Cats 
     chase dogs". The hacker should change it to something else, 
     for example "Dogs chase cats".

     In anticipation of VanHacking contest, the World Wide Web 
     server that VirTech employs will in no way be modified. No 
     security beefing up, firewalling for example, will be done 
     to protect the server. The server will run a network suite 
     On the opening day of the challenge, a third party 
     accountancy official will verify that the page exists. The 
     page will then be immediately assigned a password in the 
     presence of the official in order to mark the beginning of 
     the challenge. During the course of the challenge, the 
     official will be called upon bi-weekly to re-verify that the 
     page is still exists.

     Further information can be obtained from the VanHacking 
     challenge Web site at [ http://www.vanhacking.com ].

*** VAX/VMS Hacking Challenge 
From: "me you" <simbiont@hotmail.com> 
=============================================================================

>if I log in as GUEST, then my process name is always something like 
>"GUEST_2", however, if I log in as GUEST/NOCOMM (i.e., take me straight to the 
>shell bypass that menu) then I get a process name of this  ' Process name: 
>"_NTY77:" .. maybe something, maybe not. Jist thought i'd share.

when you login as GUEST/NOCOMM basicly you're bypassing login.com. 
Login.com file has all world/group privilages flaged off, therfore you 
cant even look at it. when login.com is executed then couple things 
happen (I can tell these by doing "sh proc/full" ) another process 
starts shadowing guest user and I persume it's recording the users 
activities. second,  and this one is abvious, it starts the menu. what 
else does it do? your guess is as good as mine.

you can't edit login.com but you can make newer version of this 
file(which will basicly cause a bypass of the original login.com) by 
doing"edit login.com;2" if the original was login.com;1. you can put 
your own initialization commands here and next time you run it (or login 
again) this new version will run instead.

there's also sys$system:sylogin.com that gets executed everytime you 
login. if you can hack this file you can fix it to give you sys 
privilages and therefor get challenge.txt

e-mail me at <simbiont@hotmail.com> if you need more VMS info. 
as I said before, you cant edit this file but

Check out  http://netlab1.usu.edu/novell.faq/nov-faq.htm

This is the FAQ page for the Novell Netware mailing list which I used to 
be subscribed to.  I've found it an EXCELLENT resource for any type of 
Netware question.  I'd recommend however that before you post, that you do 
read the very extensive FAQ that not only has instructions on subscribing, 
but information on security, TCP/IP, e-mail, backups, the Internet, and 
much more.

Oh, and I wouldn't recommend asking "How do I hack Netware?" The sys 
admins on the list don't like that.  :-)

The bad logins are stored in the /var/logs/messages file... 
(or the ./message file whereever your sysadmin likes to save the logs)

Note that a hell of a lot of other junk is also stored in this file. I'd 
suggest a grep for the words "LOGIN FAILURE"...

*** Bypassing Caller ID, etc. 
From: Brinley Ang <brinley@pacific.net.sg> 
============================================================================= 
 

Hello, here's a stupid question from a newbie, in my district, almost 
everyone has a Caller ID*including me*, and this has been a nusiance 
because my wardialer keeps getting human carriers and I get alot of 
people calling my number up and screwing me... then I have to give a 
stupid explaination about my little brother who likes to play with the 
fone etc etc... So I was wonder is there a way to anonymise the phone 
number so that it does not appear on the caller ID nor work on the call 
back *U know? U receive a call, then juz press ** or something like that 
to call back that person?*

[Matt: In my area, you can make a private call by dialing *67, waiting for 
tone, and then dialing the regular number. It might be different in other 
areas. You can probably just dial 0 and ask the operator. So, all the numbers 
you scan will have to be in the form of "*67,,xxxxxxx" (or something similar). 
Keep in mind that people with Caller ID can ignore private calls or have the 
telco block them.]

Here's another question, I have access to this university, but the 
/etc/passwd is shadowed, I think I'm supposed to look for the unshadowed 
one rite, but those which look like it e.g /etc/passwd.old .I juz can't 
access them.

[Matt: See what you can do with just the usernames.]

Pls enlighten me

Unless you can find a server that doesn't run identd, you can get caught 
really easily. In many jurisdictions use of U* ***** is illegal as a denial 
of service attack. Its "flamer" email list subscription attack can crash the 
mail server of an entire ISP. According to Ira Winkler, author of the book 
Corporate Espionage and a member of the FBI Infrastructure Task Force, angry 
johnny (johnny xchaotic) has some warrants out for his arrest for his 
Chistmas 1996 flamer bombings. I haven't tested some of the latest ******* 
denial of service features such as the chargen port attack, but if they 
work, too, they are also illegal.

If you can find one of the rare servers that are not running indentd, you 
still are not necessarily safe. You likelihood of being arrested also 
depends on what forensic standards your nation requires for indictment and 
conviction for computer crimes.

Matt, will you please run this in the Digest, but making [anonymous]

hey.. 
on my ISP, i've been trying to compile port scanners [pscan.c and strobe] 
without luck...i've been using the correct compiler and commands but it 
still hasn't worked. I email the tech support guy and told him i've been 
trying to compile an IRC bot and *he said* he couldn't help me because all 
IRC servers have a ban on bots. So, i was wondering how i should ask him 
about compiling sumpthin like pscan, etc. without raising supision?? and 
thats the LAST thing i need.. =))

[Matt: You can't mention a port scanner to an ISP without raising suspicion. 
They just don't like them. It makes 'em nervous. A good shell account always 
has several interpreters and compilers, and they should all work normally. Send

From: Michael Robinson 
<kaaos@teleport.com>

Hiyas Carol,

I'm sorry for mailing you like this, but I'm in dire straits here.  I have 
been a subscriber to your list for quite a while now and finally have my own 
question to ask.  I have been charged with repeatedly breaking into a local 
college's server, a college that is in a neighboring state (I'm in 
Washington, the college is in Oregon.)  As all know, crossing state lines 
means big fun for the accused :(

I am desperately looking for any information I can find regarding a lawyer 
that handles such cases, or anyone that can help me.  I don't have much to 
give, I'm certainly not the richest dope around.  I have never done anything 
malicious towards anyone on the net, especially not to anyone's server.  I 
don't expect you to believe me, and don't ask you to.  All I ask is that you 
maybe broadcast my message to the Happy Hacker list to see if I can 
hopefully get some help.

[Carolyn: I figure anyone who has been on the Happy Hacker list for awhile 
knows how easy it is to get caught if you hack out of your own account and 
don't do IP spoofing. So it is much more likely that someone else set 
Robinson up. Skilled computer criminals often hack into other peoples' 
accounts to do their dirty work. For example, every time the Gray Areas 
Liberation Front has hacked Happy Hacker, they have done so from a chain of 
hacked accounts. If anyone wishes to step forward to defend Robinson, I will 
be glad to assist with technical information on why one should *never* 
assume that the owner of the account from which a computer crime originates 
is the actual perpetrator.]

The Happy Hacker list has 4,300 subscribers. Arghhhh! That keeps a mail 
server pretty busy! Please consider the option of unsubscribing and instead 
making regular visits to Matt Hinze's official Happy Hacker site at 
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/matt/hh.html. Honest to gosh, we won't be 
offended if you unsubscribe.

Happy hacking, and be good! OK?
