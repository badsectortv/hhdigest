 Moderator's Note: 
  This is a quite large Digest.  I was away (camping) for the weekend, 
 and my 
  e-mail built up.  I was away from my PC and the Internet for 3 whole 
 days, 
  so I was unable to produce a digest.

         Trojan Horse Question 
 ---------------------------------------- 
  
 To: "'hh@happy-hacker.ml.org'" <hh@happy-hacker.ml.org> 
 Subject: [hh]  win95 passwords via trojan horse     (please do not post 
 return email address...) 
  
 I was reading a column in the august issue of Windows NT magazine that 
 said: 
  
 "Your Win95 password may be at risk if you log unattended Win95 
 computers on to your network.  Hackers can obtain a user's network 
 password by programmatically examining the computer's memory. 
 Ordinarily, for such an attack to be possible, the hacker must have 
 physical access to the computer.  However, from the Internet, a user can 
 unknowingly download a Trojan horse that scans for passwords.  The 
 Trojan horse affects the logged-on user.  Win95 encrypts password before 
 sending them over the network, but it temporarily stores the network 
 password for the logged on user in memory in an unencrypted state. 
 Microsoft confirmed this problem in Win95 and OEM Service Release 2 
 (OSR2).  To address this problem, the company has released an update 
 that's available on Microsoft's website...." yadda yadda yadda....... 
  
 Question: 
  
 I know what a Trojan Horse does, but i'm not sure why it does what it 
 does....  my experience with them is very limited... (Theoretically, of 
 course..) how does one go about embedding a Trojan Horse in a 
 downloadable program?  Is the information form the TH written to a log 
 file, which can be retrieved?  Or, in the above instance, is that 
 password information transfered back via internet to the person 
 "inquiring"?  And what's usually the most common way a TH is used?  Is 
 it used in conjunction with a "real" program, but running the TH on the 
 side, out of view?  Many questions... :)

 Subject: modifying windows 
  
 Does anybody know how to really modify Windows' look and feel? Something 
 like changing the actual shapes of windows from having squared edges to 
 round ones, or animating the drop down menus as they appear, something 
 along those lines.  How would you go about breaking down the kernel to 
 modify it in this way? 
  
 Thanks,

 program 
 is available from Microsoft's web site.  Look for something called 
 PowerToys.  It

 Can u tell me if it is possible to link 2 home puters together through 
 the net. Me and a friend tried it, gave each other our ip address's, 
 tried ftp, tried finger prog's, but the only way we could link up 
 together was through IRC, but obviously couldn't check out what was on 
 each others machine, which was our main objective. I'm sure that it is 
 possible, but how to do it? 
  
 my friend works in IT but he still didn't have a clue. 
  
 any help would be kindly appreciated :-) 
  
 I have been through most of the GTMHH's before you refer me there.

 >Date: 97-08-26 09:10:29 EDT 
 > 
 >Hi,

 pclockout

 >pclockout? or is there a way of getting past the password? 
  
 gday, there's a few different ways of getting past PcLockout. And most 
 of them have to do with miss-configurations in the setup of it. (The 
 *teachers* don't know enough) 
  
 On boot up you can try pressing SHIFT and by-passing the startup files. 
 Then you'll find you can't type anything but the numberpad. You'll also 
 find that you can only press ENTER once before the machine appears to 
 lock itself. 
 Basically what you need to do is press ALT-### and type out the whole 
 command line you want to execute. 
  
 The mainfiles to pclockout are pcl.sys and pcl.exe (from memory) 
 btw. don't delete these files, i think that the machines stuff up when 
 you do. 
  
 There's an easier way to do things but, 
 if the machines are networked through windows, just share the C: of the 
 machine you want to get into and make it Read-Write (write is what we 
 need). Then get onto another machine and access the shared drive... you 
 can now copy files to the drive (i.e. overwrite config.sys so as it 
 doesn't load pcl.sys???). One drawback is that you can't delete files 
 from the shared drive. 
  
 if all else fails, use that lill' program called 'debug' and start 
 working out how ta alter pcl in memory. I've heard that you need only 
 write over 1 byte. 
  
 If if all else fails, befriend the admin (teacher) and ask for the 
 password... else run a keylogger and tell the teacher to change 
 something with the config. 
  
 Btw: there's also a pclockout main disk, I think that this needs a 
 password but. A thought of mine would be to make a linux bootdisk and 
 try to mount the MSDOS partition and then see if it's Read-writable... 
  
 That's about all I can think of. Except, make your school get a better 
 OS... I managed to sneak a copy of linux onto the server at school, and 
 no one can tell except it says "LILO" on bootup :) 
  
 Now that's over. 
 I have a question. At my latest educational institute I'm at, we are 
 installing/trialling Cytrix networking. It is installed on a 2xP6200 
 using NT 3.51 Service pack 5. does anyone know of any half decent 
 vunerabilities I could try on it... 
 the ports open are: 
     19 (chargen)-- already had fun with that, network chugged with a few 
     telnets open to it. 
     7 (echo) don't know what to try. 
     qotd -- lotsa fun (actually just a waste of class time) 
     daytime - pretty boring. 
     139 (netbios) - soon to try WinNuke (but I don't like my chances of 
     success.) 
  
 The network is connected to the inet, and has about 15 computers on it.. 
  
 problems I have already found: 
     telnet to 127.1.1.1 19: can't close telnet window without ending 
     task (of which 90%  of the students cant do) 
     opening many programs: crashes the server in 10 seconds flat. 
     3 trys and you're banned: keeping ppl from logging on (lame) by 
     entering bogus passwords (NT default crod) 
  
 also Cytrix WinFrame uses the local hdd to boot off... therefore 
 allowing for a login spoof, does anyone have one made, or have a .bmp of 
 the Cytrix background.

 I want to print out large files concerning hacking, phreaking, etc. 
 (especially the Rainbow series) from the school library because my 
 printer is pathetically slow.  All of the school computers are hooked up 
 to some kind of network which controls the printers.  My question is if 
 anybody could monitor what I acutally print out?  And would there be any 
 log file to alert them to do this if somebody printed out a 100 page 
 document? 
  
 Thanks for your time,

               Legal Stuff 
 ---------------------------------------- 
  
 From: Merlin Kauffman <merlink@vnet.net> 
 To: hh@happy-hacker.ml.org 
 Subject: WinNuke 
  
 I was wondering what the punishment would be if you were caught for 
 WinNuking??  I know that it is against the law because it is a DOS 
 Attack 
 (Denial Of Service) and is not letting people have access to their 
 computers, or the internet.  But then again, what are the chances of 
 getting caught, it is nearly impossible.  Even if people do get the bug 
 fix, and it tells them the IP that is trying to Nuke them, the only 
 thing 
 they could do is e-mail root at that domain and hope something happens 
 to 
 the user.  Most likely root wont even know who the user is, unless you 
 know 
 the exact time that the Nuking occured, and its not like root is even 
 gonna 
 give a flying F*CK about it. root wont wanna waste the time to look back 
 in 
 all of the logs of incoming connections, dial-up or telnet.  If people 
 really want to avoid WinNuking and pingfloods, you might as well get a 
 real 
 OS like Linux, and then setup a firewall and be safe.  If you dont want 
 Linux, then   just get the bug fix for either Win95 or WinNT.

 are 
 rarely enforced. So kids discover they can get away with stuff, power 
 goes 
 to their heads, and pretty soon you have a Kevin Mitnick in jail for 
 many 
 years because he committed a long series of basically trivial crimes 
 which 
 eventually irritated too many of the wong people, most notably the New

  Full Armor Tutorial 
 ---------------------------------------- 
  
 From: Dave Manges <dmanges@epower.net> 
 To: hh@happy-hacker.ml.org 
 Subject: HH 
  
 For all of those going up against a PC security program called "Full 
 Armor", I ran up against this program 8 months ago at school, they 
 attempted to prevent people from writing to the hard drive. It presented 
 itself as a challenge....for about 5 minutes. 
 To crack it..... 
  
 1. In the properties of the program it mentions the thread file (can't 
 remember the name of the file) it was something.vbx 
  
 2. Ok...this is easy enough, open notepad, open something.vbx 
  
 3. Just because I can't write to the hard drive doesn't mean I can't 
 edit something already there, delete the first character from the file. 
  
 4. The file (opened in notepad) looks like garbage, but if memory serves 
 the first letter was M. 
  
 5. Save the File and restart the computer, it should come up with an 
 error like "Unable to Initialize Full Armor". 
  
 6. Now you can go into add/remove programs and uninstall it. 
  
 Enjoy.....Dave

 Also, before you transfer ANY file that isn't text, make sure you type 
 BINARY so the transfer comes through in a usable format.  Also, the hash 
 command is nice, as it lets you know that the transfer is still in 
 progress and the computer hasn't hung.

  FoolProof Facts... 
 ---------------------------------------- 
  
 From: dante <dante@suffer.tusculum.edu> 
 To: hh@happy-hacker.ml.org 
 Subject: HH 
  
 I just read a post on getting past fool-proof in win95, which was 
 accurate, but only to a degree.  It wasn't very helpful, because it 
 lacked the details. 
  
 Ironically, my comp. science teacher asked me to show her exactly HOW I 
 managed to print the "the universe revoles around me" image I made to 
 all the network printers in the school. C'mon, it's my hs senior year, 
 and i wanted to leave a lasting impression. 
  
 So anyway, with her persmission, and watching closely behind me: 
  
 As far as i know, the newest fp software was the hardest to get by 
 because it was in the registry, and to edit the registry, and to hack it 
 in one sitting, you have to change the registry. 
  
 First thing to do, is reboot, hitting f8 when starting windown 95... 
 shows up. 
  
 Select safe mode command prompt. 
  
 edit autoexec and config.sys, remarking any reference to "fp", (should 
 be one device= in config.sys, and one fptsr.exe in autoexec) 
  
 After that, reboot again, and hit f8 again, this time, just selecting 
 safe mode. This bypasses the registry, which i accidentally found out. 
 At least it doesn't load the fp devices.  Type in regedit at either a 
 command prompt or from the 'run' menu. 
  
 Search for 'fp' and delete any line that has any kind of resemblence to 
 foolproof or fpsetup.exe. 
  
 (Did you backup the registry so when yer done you can re-import it and 
 not get kicked out of school?) 
  
 save the registry, and reboot, this time, as normal. 
  
 Fool-proof should not show up whatsoever. 
  
 If your admin was smart enough to put in msdos.sys the nof8 thingy, i 
 forget what it is exactly, then you'll have to make a boot disk. If they 
 enabled c:, a: boot seqence then you'll have to edit the bios, and if 
 there is a password for admin on bios, then you'll have to open the 
 case, pull off the battery, and put it back on.  But that's trivial 
 stuff at this point. 
  
 I just added drivers for all the network printers on this particular 
 computer and reprinted to each device.  10 minutes later i got a message 
 from the assistant principle to go see him. 
  
 We laughed. 
  
 Anyway, fp is a fairly simple hack, but with work, it could be more 
 secure. the hardest part it the deal wth the registry. 
  
 have fun.

 A way to gain access to the control panel with foolproof is to: 
 Hit F3 to bing up the Find menu, then search for *.cpl in the 
 windows directory, all the files it finds are for the control 
 panel, just click on the one that says 'display.cpl' for Display 
 and so on and so fourth...

 When a ping is sent to an IP address, is there a record of that ping on 
 that IP as a matter of course?  And, if not, is there a way to record 
 the 
 origins of incoming pings?  I have heard that pings can be used to 
 disable 
 other computers and that nasty trick should have a defense.  Is there 
 one? 
 What kind of damage to hardware can a ping do?

 From: krazilek@anon.nymserver.com 
  
 Hi there, 
 ok...just a few things.... 
 In the August 15 HH thingo a guy called Sitepu Orang said that he 
 changed the IP address on a machine and he couldn't browse the network 
 in network neighbourhood, i believe this is because nethood doesn't 
 support browsing outside the subnet mask, eg. 
 if you are on a LAN, and you IP was 192.168.0.1 with a ubnet mask of 
 255.255.255.0 then you would only be able to see computers in the same 
 subnet..192.168.0.*. 
 you changed your ip to something else...192.0.0.1 for example, you can 
 only access computers in 19w.168.0.* so you couldn't get to your old 
 computers.. 
 There is still a tcp connection though so you can still ping it or 
 access a server running from it. (web/ftp/mail/news/gateway/etc..) 
  
 Also, could the ppl at HH tell me what sorta mail server they are 
 running, i noticed that it is off a dynamic ip address through monlith, 
 possibly not a dynip but i need a mail server for my computer...

  Ok!  I have started to include Unix/Linux posts in the Digests.  There

but 
  Until so, because of everyone's requests, I will start including 
  Linux/Unix posts.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to answer as 
  many questions as I would like to, so we will have to leave that

  that we get, the easier it will be to branch off a separate Digest

       Fortres101 Facts... 
----------------------------------------

From: Aaaaargh@aol.com 
To: hh@happy-hacker.ml.org 
Subject: HH about Fortres 101

My school just got a bunch of Win95 computers.  They set up Fortres101 
on all 
of them for security.  For those of you who don't know fortres (with 1 
s) is 
a security program for different versions of windows, it uses existing 
windows and dos commands as well as a few programs of it's own, and puts 
them 
into a very user friendly, menu driven format.  Win95 comes with IE 3.0 
which, as we all know is full of holes, one of which can be used to get 
around Fortres101.  If you type a drive letter followed by a colon into 
the 
"adress" box of IE 3.0 then it will act as a shell and display the 
contents 
of that drive, it also allows you to navigate it without many 
restrictions. 
 Some folders that are specifically locked by Fortres will remain 
protected 
but other files that were thought to be unnaccessable because of the 
security 
program can be accessed.  For example I accessed Regedit without any 
hassle 
what so ever.  I told the guy in charge of computers about the hole and 
he 
gave me a job :-)  If anyone else has any info on Fortres101 please 
either 
post it to this list or E-mail me at Aaaaargh@aol.com.

Hello,

Ive been wondering a few things .. First, how come when I telnet into a

several times to send a message (following instructions from the GTMHH 
that covered it) and it seemed to work ok .. But, I would never receive 
the message I sent ... (I sent to another email address of mine) Any 
ideas?

Second, how would you go about intercepting email? I hear people say it 
can be done but I dont know where to start .. could someone point me in 
the right direction? of course, i will be intercepting my own email just 
for the sake of learning .. No other particular reasons.. :)

hmm,

this answer is to an old question, but I hope it's OK anyway.

To "Crack" Wingroove v0.9, do like this:

1. Open Wingroove Setup 
2. Click on Register 
3. Choose the last option 
4. Enter this...

The first text-box: "ZAAAAAAA" 
The second box: "BJG70109" 
The third box: "Your name" e.g. "Mister Smith"

That's it!

Have a nice Day!

Subject: HH: Re ICMP'd

Re: Ping Attacks

ICMP :) There is no way to protect your self from that. ICMP Unreach is 
used on IRC to kick you out, but usually a server is supposed to send 
you 
that. It's like can't contact the host so close the connection. So, one 
way 
to protect yourself from being kicked out of the IRC is 
a) sit behind a firewall (unreach from other people doesn't work) 
b) choose another server/port. for example on EFnet irc.nwlink.com seems 
to 
be unfloodable :)

THE QUESTION WAS:

From:  xDeath <ashufelt@mhv.net>

Hello, 
        I have become aware of little wanna-be hackers going around to 
IRC 
EFnet servers and "smurfing" them (killing them with packets) and they 
are not going to come back up. 
        I am sending this e-mail to ask why are these people stooping so 
low to 
remove an IRC server.  What do they gain by doing so?  I do not see that 
they are doing it for any worthy cause, it seems they are just doing it 
to get their "jollys" by preforming such a malicious act.  I would like 
to know if there is any way to prevent this so that the EFnet don't not 
soon become non-existant.  (effected and non-returning servers: 
irc.texas.net and irc.gate.net)

Sincerely, 
xDeath

ANSWER:

        Seems that some people just hate everything.  I think it's the 
whole 
anarchy/rebelion thing.  I'm not sure why they would want to take down 
servers for good.  Although you can make a server split (not to be 
confused 
with killing it).  These people might be trying to split the server to 
takeover a channel. 
        As far as EFnet going down, I don't think so.  There is always 
more 
servers that want to link to EFnet.  In fact, we just set up the 
miami.fl 
server here. 
        In any case, 2 out of every 3 "irc hackers" are total lamers. 
So, don't 
worry about it.

THE QUESTION WAS:

From: cdcd <cdcd@thepentagon.com> 
To: The Happy Hacker <hh@happy-hacker.ml.org> 
Subject: Ping Attacks

hh I am currently being iCMP'd as I sit down to write this... I am off 
of a Win95 machine, is there a fix for iCMP?

ANSWER:

        ICMPs or Nukes or whatever you want to call them are just lots 
of big 
pings really.  There is no patch that I know of that can stop them 
because 
it's not a bug in any code, it's just ping packets.  But that doesn't 
mean 
you can't protect yourself. 
        What you need is something called an ICMP Scanner to see who is 
nuking 
you.  I recomend ICMP Watch 2.1 by Rhad Ware.  You can get it at 
http://www.7thsphere.com along with other stuff to help protect 
yourself.

Hope that helps

Solution 
        Open Explorer, click View then Options. Click File Types. In the 
Registered File Types look for Folder and edit its properties.  In the

Why don't you check out your network properties?  Try sharing your HDD 
by 
adding new network components.  Just an idea if there's a telnet daemon 
for 
WIN95, you could use that.  Hope this helps...

Hello. I'd like to find out about ROUTING stuff. 
Our educational institution has 12- 20 computers running Win 3.11 and 
Dos. 
The server is Novell for 25 Users . One day we decided to set up an 
internet 
and we have to install a ROUTER. I wonder what Os and Software we have 
to 
Install on the ROUTER? I work with Linux and i know that it supports 
some 
kinda routing stuff. So I'd appreciate any information about routing on 
mashines for Internet.

P.s I think that we will use Dial Up for connecting to the I-NET.

Thanx alot

 Mini-Linux Difficulties 
----------------------------------------

From: Shade <shade@tir.com> 
To: hh@happy-hacker.ml.org 
Subject: MiniLinux

Recently I went and downloaded minilinux to install on my 486. But it 
just won't work... It has no strange readings at startup until it gets 
to the following line: 
        VMS:Mounted Root 
And then is freezes, and won't move. 
Heres the stats on the computer I'm trying to install it on.

486DX - ~133mhz 
350Meg Total Harddrive - 30-40Megs left after minilinux install. 
Modem 28.8 on Com1 
Running - DOS 6.22 & Win3.1

I've looked through the rc.s files and can't really see anything wrong 
there, but doesn't this problem take effect before it gets to the 
initialization files? I'm really a complete newbie to linux and thats 
why I've been trying to find an answer, so I can learn the system.

Well, I've floated this question around the Happy Hacker Chat List for a 
while now, and noone seems to know what the problem is. I hope I can 
find the answer here. Thanx.

Good day,

I just spent the last 2 days learnign about the probelms and 
installation 
processes involving Linux (Slackware)  I had a similar problem to yours 
where i didn't want to wipe out the info I already had on my HD by 
partitioning it.  (Needless to say I found out after erasing all of my 
data 
and the 70MB download of Slackware) that there is a program that runs 
under 
DOS called fips.exe that will let you move things around within your 
existing partition without deleting it and create a partition for 
Linux. 
  There was also a way to install Linux in an MS-DOS directory and have 
it 
work but other thatn that I haven't seen any usefull info on it.

Ciao
