FINGER QUESTION

Anonymous post:

I have been trying lately to finger some servers and have managed it use it 
successfully, 
Every time (well almost) I finger a server with @ it brings up a list with 
the users and it also presents their current status.. please explain to me 
what TTY is and what is meant by the user being idle. I think I already know 
what the latter means but just in case explain it plz

Moderator: TTY is the file that represents the user's terminal. For example, 
when you are logged on and you want to know how your connection to the host 
computer is represented, give the command "tty."

What does "idle" mean? Just what it sounds like. However, could anyone help 
me with the question of why "root" often turns up with an idle time of days 
or even weeks? I hope it doesn't mean someone has logged in as root and left 
that session open on an unattended terminal -- that would really be a no-no.

HELP FOR DUTCH HACKERS

Regarding the question of XS4ALL:  XS4ALL is actually one of the most 
liberal providers in the Netherlands.  They're actually seen as one of the 
pioneers and actively participate in the whole Internet Freedom movement, 
such as the Scientology issue.  What I have heard, though, is that they've 
restricted shell access to limit access to more "sensitive" areas, which 
could be restrictive to hackers.  And BTW, I don't work for XS4ALL...

WIN WOES

From: Nils Janson <wyoguys@twd.net>

Although this has no bearing whatsoever on hacking (or, at least, not 
much of one) I felt the need to post this in a forum where I wouldn't 
get flamed.  Anyway, I'm having trouble setting up a winsock with dns 
servers and other things.  The reason that I'm having so much trouble is 
that I don't know how to set it up manually, and when I try to use an 
installing winsock it doesn't recognize ISDN at all, so I don't have any 
way of doing this.  All the help texts that I've found are in German or 
are of no help whatsoever.  Please please please please please send all 
responses to my email address, not post it in the newsletter.  Thanks.

LINUX ANSWER

Sir,

I believe if you move your dir's i.e. c:\base, c:\rpms to: 
c:\redhat\base 
c:\redhat\rpms

I believe that will solve this problem!

Good Luck!

LEGAL STUPH

Moderator: We have a series of GTMHH in the works that cover cyberlaw citing 
the statutes. In the meantime, for US cyberlaw info, see the CyberLaw 
Internet site http://www.cyberlaw.com. The lawyer who runs this site is 
Jonathan Rosenoer. He has also written an excellent book, _CyberLaw_, 
Springer, 1997. He also puts out an ezine, Cyberlex. For more information, see: 
CyberLaw.com 
Jonathan Rosenoer, Esq.  | Kentfield, California, USA

Ph. 415-461-3108            | Fax 415-461-4013

There is also a cyberlaw forum at http://www.infowar.com.

Please remember, when we discuss the law we are not lawyers and we are not 
offering you legal advice. We are simply discussing the law as we are able 
to understand it. Your best bet for staying out of trouble  is the Golden 
Rule: if you are doing something to someone else's computer that you 
wouldn't want done to yours, don't do it!

Now our first post in this section today refers to the war dialing question, 
as well as to computer trespassing in general.

From: rydell@juno.com (Code Of Law)

As far as I can tell, in section 156.10 labeled 'Computer trespass'

 "A person is guilty of computer trespass when he knowingly uses 
or causes to be used a computer or computer service without authorization 
and: 
 1, he does so with an intent to commit or attempt to commit or 
further the commission of  any felony; or 
 2, he thereby knowingly gains access to computer material."

 This is labeled as a class E felony

 Still the section above (156.05) labeled 'Unauthorized use of a 
computer' says: 
 "A person is guilty of unauthorized use of a computer when he 
knowingly uses or causes to be used a computer or computer service 
without authorization and the computer utilized is equipped or programmed 
with any device or coding system, a function of which is to prevent the 
unauthorized use of said computer or computer system" 
  
 This is labeled a Class A misdemeanor.  Now the difference 
between a misdemeanor and a felony in these cases is quite great if 
someone is ever charged.  I'm not quite sure how one would tell the 
difference between the two, except if someone was to break in and do 
nothing(misdemeanor) or if they walked around the system(felony).  Either 
way it doesn't look too friendly.

 This is all from the 1993 Looseleaf Law Publication in section 
156

Hi, 
I've found a server that allows for it's passwd file to be 
read/downloaded with an anon. ftp connection.  Is this unusual, or 
standard?  Is it illegal for me to download the file to my home computer? 
 What would one do with the passwd file?

Moderator: I'll bet this availability of the password file is accidental. 
Since the server made no attempt to protect it, IMHO you probably won't get 
in trouble. What some hackers would do with this file is run it through a 
crack program to extract the passwords from the encrypted versions you 
probably found. But once you extract the clear text of these passwords you 
may be breaking the law under the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 
amendments to  18 USC: Chapter 47,Section 1029. This prohibits fraud and 
related activity that is made possible by counterfeit access devices. 
Penalty is a fine of $50,000 or twice the value of the crime and/or up to 15 
years in prison, $100,000 and/or up to 20 years if repeat offense.

Hey there...  Better post this to the list so EVERYONE knows.

Jerircho, as persuant to some ACT made by the FCC, making random phone 
calls before 8 AM and after 8 PM is illegal.

From: jericho@dimensional.com

As for using war dialer software in the US, I would like you to quote that 
source. I know in Colorado there is a statue which makes it a misdemeanor 
to "wardial without the intent to communicate" (not exact words) in 
Colorado Springs. In Denver, there is no such statute.

> Moderator: Email bombing is a denial of service attack. If the attack

Stop. That is a blanket statement that is untrue in some cases. If you 
email bomb someone by subscribing them to 1000 mail lists, and they are 
sitting on a T3 or better, running a mail server with half a gig of RAM, 
and a few gigs for the mail spool, it is not a denial of service attack. 
You are not stopping them from using any service. You are simply being a 
pain in the ass. If you do the same to someone on a P5/32M/1.2g with a 
28.8 static connection, you are then denying them service.

If you are going to speak like this, make sure you fully qualify your 
statements.

Moderator: Hmm, does dimensional.com have a T1? Does that mean you think it 
would be OK to email bomb you? Have you ever tried to sort out legitimate 
email messages from among 25 MB per day of email bomb spam? Maybe it's easy 
for you, but for most people their email is as good as lost. Many people 
even have to close their accounts after getting email bombed. Now that is 
denial of service.

I disagree. He did NOT say, "As the Jews were persecuted for their 
religious beliefs, so are the child molesters." In fact, he did not even 
say child molester. He said that if he sees a site that he may "find 
distasteful" he has no right to destroy it. Absolutely correct. Now, back to 
the original argument. Kiddie porn is illegal. Hacking is illegal. 
Illegally hack illegal kiddie porn sites. Fine with me.

I agree that Carolyn's statement is off the wall and out of place in this

ethics such as Jesus, Gandhi and Martin Luther King is like trying to 
discuss TCP/IP without referencing RFCs.
