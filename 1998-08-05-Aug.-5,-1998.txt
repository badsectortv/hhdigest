 *** Re: Backdoor in ircN, popular mIRC script 
================================================================== 
From: Benoit Lefebvre <mox@SHELLZ.NETREVOLUTION.COM>

The bug is not only in ircNIt is in mIRC. 
The problem is $calc(..)

ircN is just one of the scripts who use $calc to check the ping delay 
eg:

 on 1:CTCPREPLY:PING*: { echo -a Ping reply: $calc($ctime - $2) }

To protect yourself, add this to your script:

on 1:CTCPREPLY:PING*: { if ($2 !isnum) { halt } }

 *** Back Orifice released 
=================================================================== 
From: anonymous

The CULT OF THE DEAD COW (cDc) will release Back Orifice, a remote MS 
Windows Administration tool at Defcon VI in Las Vegas (www.defcon.org) 
on August 1.

Programmed by Sir Dystic [cDc], Back Orifice is a self-contained, 
self-installing utility which allows the user to control and monitor 
computers running the Windows operating system over a network.

Sir Dystic sounded like an overworked sysadmin when he said, "The two main 
legitimate purposes for BO are, remote tech support aid and employee 
monitoring and administering [of a Windows network]."

Back Orifice is going to be made available to anyone who takes the time to 
download it. So what does that mean for anyone who's bought into 
Microsoft's Swiss cheese approach to security? Plenty according to 
Mike Bloom, Chief Technical Officer for Gomi Media in Toronto.

"The current path of learning I see around me is to learn what you have to 
to cover your ass, go home and watch Jerry. Microsoft has capitalized on 
this at the cost of production value which translates down to security. A 
move like releasing [Back Orifice] means that the lowest common 
denominator of user will have to come to understand the threat, and that 
it is not from [Sir Dystic] writing an app that [potentially] turns Win32 
security on its ear, but that Microsoft has leveraged itself into a 
position where anyone who wants to can download an app [or write their 
own!] and learn a few tricks and make serious shit happen."

None of this is lost on Microsoft. But then again, they don't care. 
Security is way down on their list of priorities according to security 
expert Russ Cooper of NT BUGTRAQ (www.ntbugtraq.com). "Microsoft doesn't 
care about security because I don't believe they think it affects their 
profit. And honestly, it probably doesn't." Nice. But regardless of which 
side of the firewall you sit on, you can't afford not to have a copy of 
Back Orifice. Here are the specs:

Back Orifice (BO) allows the user to remotely control almost all parts of 
the operating system, including: 
     File system 
     Registry 
     System 
     Passwords 
     Network 
     Processes

* BO contains extensive multimedia control, allowing images to be captured 
from the server machine's screen, or from any video input device attached 
to the machine.

* BO has an integrated HTTP server, allowing uploads and downloads of 
files to and from a machine on any port using any http client.

* BO has an integrated packet sniffer, allowing easy monitoring of network 
traffic.

* BO has an integrated keyboard monitor, allowing the easy logging of 
keystrokes to a log file.

* BO allows connection redirection, allowing connections to be bounced off 
a machine to any other machine on the Internet.

* BO allows application redirection, allowing text based applications 
running on the server machine to be controlled via a simple telnet 
session.  Even open a remote shell.

* BO has a simple plugin interface, allowing additional modules to be 
written by third parties, and executed in Back Orifice's hidden system process.

* BO is EASY TO INSTALL!  Simply run the server, and it installs itself, 
and removes the executable it was originally run from, or it can be 
attached to any other Windows executable, which will run normally after 
installing the Back Orifice server.

* BO is TRANSPARENT!  Back Orifice does not show up in the task list, or 
even the Close Programs dialog, it is automatically restarted each time 
the computer boots, and does not affect the operation of any otherapplications.

* BO is CONFIGURABLE!  The filename that Back Orifice installs itself as, 
the port Back Orifice communicates on, and the encryption key are all 
configurable before the server is installed.

* BO is ENCRYPTED!  Communication packets used by Back Orifice are 
encrypted with a user definable key, so only the intended client can 
control the server.

* BO is FREE!  All the functionality mentioned above AND MORE is available 
in the 120k server, along with an easy to use text based or GUI client, 
Back Orifice comes with everything you need to distribute and control any 
number of machines.

* BO is GROWING!  New features, increased efficiency, new plugins, and 
more support are being added to Back Orifice every day.

After August 3, Back Orifice will be available from www.cultdeadcow.com 
free of charge. For further details or lucrative film offers, please contact:

 *** Port Dumper v 0.8 
================================================================== 
From: Twinsen <jTwinsen@Hotmail.com>

This is a program written by myself, I use this to play with my friends.

This program is used to listen to a port (any port), and after it is 
connected with others, you can type something and Port Dumper will send 
it. It is quite useful when you want to fake a service, such http, smtp, 
etc... or even telnet (Evil Genius Tips: You know it!)

It is in my homepage, Channel X Security Information 
(http://home.netvigator.com/~jcatchan/)

It's rather old because I don't have time to update it...

I may write a guide on using it to do a specified mission (such as faking 
a http server...) later.

Hope you'll enjoy using it!

 *** VM/CMS "emulator" 
================================================================== 
From: special k <sp3cialk@yahoo.com>

Hi, I've finished writing FVM, a VM/CMS "emulator" for DOS so that 
people can practice hacking S/390s without breaking the law, or even 
being connected to the Internet.

 http://www.freeshells.net/~sp3cialk

Or if that's down try http://sp3cialk.home.ml.org.  Anyway, as you can 
see from my url, freeshells.net is offering free shell accounts, as is 
www.coppersoft.com, and joint.x-treme.org (joint is the best because 
it is run by a real hacker, doxical).

Also, i've found two new 18oo PSDN dialups, 18oo 546-1ooo and 18oo 234 2793 
(7e1, i believe). Oh yeah, I'm going to start a newsletter soon, watch out 
for it (not that it would compete with hhd though :D) Hope, i've helped out-

 *** Lamers ruin it again REPLY 
================================================================== 
From: Modify <mdy@sekurity.org>

What did you expect when you posted a message to a newbie hacking list 
that gave the url of a site that offered free shells?  Of course there are 
going to be people running around rampant doing stupid crap like that...

It's a free shell what do they have to lose?  Next time keep the info to 
yourself or give it to responsible people that aren't gonna go crazy just 
because they have access to a unix shell.

 *** Massive Effort 
================================================================== 
From: "Callous D'Marco" <callousdmarco@hotmail.com>

I don't know if this has ever been posted before but there has been a 
massive code breaking project going for some time now.

Go to: 
http://rc5stats.distributed.net/

or

This group has already broken some encryptions, but needs more help on 
its current project RC5-64.

 *** Easy way to install linux on a DOS partition 
================================================================== 
From: "Eric Sanchez" <bsanch@megsinet.com>

Let me just start off by saying, Carolyn, (can i call you carolyn?) you rock.

Now that that's out of the way, on to the good stuff.  There is an extremely 
easy way to install Slackware Linux (kernel 2.0.34) on any dos partition, 
including FAT32 hard drives.  It's called ZIPSLACK.  You can download it 
from cdrom.com's ftp site.  Here's the direct link to it:

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware-3.5/zipslack/zipslack.zip

Once you download this whopping 32 MB file, edit the unremarked line in 
linux.bat to make it go with your partition (i.e. if you install this to 
your c drive, change it to /dev/hda1 from /dev/sda4).

Remember to run this from DOS, or it won't work.  This huge zip file's got 
everything perfect for running linux on your machine, but it doesn't come 
with X, although you can download the X files from their ftp site here:

ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware-3.5/slakware/x1/

Hope this helped you guys!

 *** Unix Phun 
================================================================= 
From: "Nathan Peters" <phoenix@stratium.ml.org>

I discovered something interesting while playing around with Unix on the 
network the other day and thought I'd share it will y'all. It involves 
sending messages to other users using nothing but the echo command.

You see, every user in Unix is using a tty.  These tty's are stored in the 
directory /dev.  If you want to find out who you are just type "who am i" 
and if you wanna find out who else is online just type "who" (You can also 
accomplish the same thing by typing "ls -al /dev/tty*").

Now that you know who is online and what tty they are on you can send a 
message using standard redirection.  For example if you know that one of 
your friends is on tty13 and you want to say hello to them just type "echo 
hello > tty13".  I think this method of sending messages is untraceable but 
I'm not too sure cuz I haven't used Unix for that long...

 *** Inaccuracy 
================================================================= 
From: <VM370x@aol.com>

In the last gtmhh you stated that a NUA number ("telenet address", actually 
telenet has been purchased by sprint and is now sprintnet) has 6 digits.  It 
doesn't have six digits, it had 14 plus a pre DNIC digit and an optional LCN 
(Logical channel number) identifier (two digits or an alphanumeric).  That 
adds up to a possible 17 digits, not six.  I think you may have gotten that 
from a quick look at the LOD/H tech journals and seen things like 201 112 
which are actaully 031100201000112 in the x.121 addressing standard.  The only 
reason you could omit all that stuff is that it's an internal DNIC connection 
to a host that happens to have a small network address (ie 121 instead of 
something like 14325.01).  Thanks, I hope i cleared things up.

From: <Gluelite@aol.com>

Hello, I've been reading your work, I think it has provide me with great help.

I'm currently in Australia, and in your guide, that whois.internic.net service 
does not support .au domains, I was just wondering where can I obtain whois 
service for Australia Domains...

thanx 
Keep up the good work

Note: there is a new way that you have to use whois.internic.net. Click here to find out how.

 *** About Netscape... 
================================================================== 
From: tulipoftx@icountry.net

Hello Ms. Meinel. I have a question. In the GTMHH on being a hero in the 
computer lab, you tell how to change Internet Explorer's "busy" graphic 
(the spinning planet thingy). Is there a way to do this in Netscape, and 
if so, how? Thanks for listening.

 *** Question From GTMHH 
================================================================== 
From: Randy Hunt

In the beginners series of the guides to mostly harmless hacking there 
is a section that tells how to get past the MS Internet Explorer 
censorship feature by deleting portions of the registry.  I followed the 
instructions and deleted the proper files(using wordpad), but when I try 
to save the new edited .reg file it gives me a popup box that says I am 
about to save the file in text-only format, which will erase all 
previous formats.  It gives me three choices, Word 6.0 document, 
Rich-text document, and text document.  None of these three will allow 
me to import my .reg file back into the registry so what am I doing 
incorrectly which keeps me from saving the altered registry file as a 
registry file in wordpad?  Any help you can offer would be greatly 
appreciated, and thank you for finally helping people who want to better 
their computer knowledge by posting GTMHH.

 *** Juno patch? 
================================================================== 
From: "Robert Michael" <whitehot@itouch.net>

Maybe you have run across the "patch" I need somewhere?

Saw a guy post a fix for Juno ads on your list. The problem is, his fix 
doesn't stop the waste of time in minutes downloading useless ads 
that Juno forces upon us. I live in a small town with no local dial 
up for Juno so it costs me 15 cents per minute for their dumb ads.

Do you know any web site or FTP site which has published a Juno patch 
so that when you dial up Juno servers, your local desktop tells Juno 
servers " don't download, we already got that ad, and that ad, and 
that ad, etc."

A patch like that would even be worth $$$$.

Regards,

Michael

 * Editorial - Picking the locks 
================================================================== 
From: Dale Holmes <editor@techbroker.com>

Picture this: There is a container, and it holds some sort of contents. 
It doesn't really matter what the contents are, or what type of container 
it is. The only thing that really matters is that the container is locked.

For whatever reason, the owner/operator of the container has decided that 
it should be locked, and that a limited, and possibly secret number of 
people should have access to it.

If you describe this scenario to a room full of people, they will react 
differently. Some of them will be pre-occupied with one thing: 
opening the container. Probably all of the people who subscribe to the 
HHD fall into this category. Hackers and Crackers and whatever else you 
want to call them all fall into this category.

Depending on a person's skill level (or arrogance), their thoughts will vary. 
Some will be thinking "I know I can get into that container..." while some 
may be thinking "I think I could get into that container...", and still others 
will be thinking "I wish I could get into that container...", but all have 
this in common: they want to get the container open.

The type of container divides the group only by the names they call themselves. 
The container could be a safe, or a computer, or a phone system, or a 
network of computers, or an encrypted email message. Safe-crackers, Hackers, 
Phreakers, NetGods, Cryptographers - white hats, black hats - it's all really 
shades of gray. There is a common thread of personality shared by all these 
people, regardless of their intentions for the contents of the container.

Most of them couldn't care less about the contents of the container. Some may 
be motivated by dreams of profiting from access to the contents, or fantasies of 
power from destroying the contents, but for most, it is not really about the 
contents. 
It is about picking the locks. It is about the process; it is about finding 
a way. 
It is almost a Zen kind of thing. It is about the journey, not the destination. 
For some, it is about never being told "you can't" or "it is impossible". It 
is sometimes 
about shattering illusions - illusions of power, or of safety.

Most of all, it is permanent. It is ingrained in our personalities. It is 
something 
that can empower us and endanger us. Sometimes it need to be fed, and 
sometimes it needs 
to be controlled, but one thing is certain - it is a force that must be 
reckoned with...
