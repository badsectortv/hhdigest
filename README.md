# The Happy Hacker E-Zine Archive

I was prompted to put this archive together because of the difficulty I had in finding it in the first place.

It appears as though although the main website index for www.happyhacker.org disappeared sometime in the middle of the first decade of the new millennium the hhdigest remained active but hidden from view until September 2015. The domain has sadly lapsed now but hopefully it will live on in this repository.

The seemingly random filenames are taken from the titles of each of the digests or email threads as they appeared in the original. I _was_ going to go for the name of the html file but then I remembered that we weren't trying to mirror the site, just the content so the title felt more fitting. They're both as non-standard as each other. 

Unfortunately due to the amount of extraneous characters left in the body of the emails it does not lend itself well to being made into markdown. If someone were so inclined then it might be possible to parse the content but I'll leave that as an exercise for someone else.
