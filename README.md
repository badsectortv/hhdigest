# The Happy Hacker E-Zine Archive

I was prompted to put this archive together because of the difficulty I had in finding it in the first place.

Unfortunately due to the amount of extraneous characters left in the body of the emails it does not lend itself well to being made into markdown. If someone were so inclined then it might be possible to parse the content but I'll leave that as an exercise for someone else.
