 *** Help Files Actually Can Be Helpful 
================================================================== 
From: "Reflux Acid" <reflux98@hotmail.com>

In my boredom, I began exploring the windows help files (Start > Help).

Now, on the computers at my school, as well as many others, the 
"Settings" folder, which is on the start menu and contains the "Control 
Panel" and "Printers" folders, is disabled (it doesn't appear on the 
"Start" menu).

Go to the Help option on the start menu, and click the "Index" tab. Now type 
in the item that you are looking to change, for example, type in "Hardware 
Settings". Press enter or double click on the highlighted option. The 
windows help window for that particular topic will then appear. In the 
explanation you will find a button (linked icon) to that particular topic. 
Using our example of changing the hardware settings, the device manager 
would appear.

You can do this to access any of the items normally located in the "Control 
Panel" or "Printers" folders. I'm sure you can find several other interesting 
things that have been disabled as well.

:)

Lots of people disagree with this form of 'Hacking Tutorial'.

Unfortunately, some also feel the need to attack and threaten such sites. 
Although I prefer not to use a violent means to my end, I also disagree 
with the publication of tutorials like the one on your site.

Power that is granted, not earned, is very dangerous. The tutorial is full 
of exploits which, if used properly, could compramise root. If used 
improperly, they could lead to being caught. Anyone who needs to use this 
tutorial (that is, anyone who doesn't already know how to hack by 
themselves) will most likely know too little to avoid causing damage. 
There's a reason why the root shell is reserved for the administrator. 
Without having to earn the privilage, a root shell tends to be rather 
intoxicating, and carelessness is almost inevitable.

Hacking isn't just a game of breaking into computers. People watch 
"Hackers", or see someone in action, and that's all that they usually see. 
They get the 'feel' of the world we live in, but don't understand where it 
comes from. They don't see the hours learning those languages which aid us. 
They don't see the everyday hacking, the programming and learning, which 
goes on. That is the true essence of hacking.

You have the Mentor's last words on your page. They speak volumes. I'm sure 
you know the answer to this question:

Who is a hacker? Someone sitting at his computer hacking root from a 
tutorial, learning little and possibly causing damage to himself and the 
system they attack, or someone sitting at her computer trying to break into 
it, understand it, and learn its code and machinery so that she can create 
those exploits?

It doesn't matter whether she's doing it in order to break into systems or 
to report the exploit to the software's author and lists like BugTraq. It 
doesn't matter whether she's breaking her system for exploits or creating a 
utility to enhance security. The second individual is a hacker.

Hacking is a drive to learn more. It can extend beyond computing, but its 
primary focus lies there because of an almost infinite potential. When you 
consider that hackers can be Black Hat, White Hat, programmers, admins, FBI 
trackers, or just some kid trying to make a web server on his Commodore 64, 
there's only one element that is common between them. Find that element, 
that one piece, and you know what hacking is.

Tutorials like the one on your site don't promote that sort of learning- 
they promote the idea that hacking is a big adventure, a game and a rush 
that can't be lost, if you're good enough. They may lead some to be 
hackers, but it's been my experience that the opposite is always the result.

As for advice, either remove the tutorial from your site, or expect more 
criticism and possibly attacks. That's the way of things. If you do take 
down the tutorial, by all means add information that will help people learn 
more. Programming tutorials are an excellent way of helping people learn on 
their own.

PS- I know that all of those exploits are available someplace else on the 
web (rootshell comes to mind). It's promoting and distributing them in the 
format that you do that brings you under fire.

 *** JavaScript Exploit 
================================================================== 
From: SIR MYST <OoIMYSTIoO@aol.com>

Hello Carolyn ,

Well i have been reading the HHD for about 5 months now. I've been around and 
in the Hacking scene for about 2 years now and I've been experimenting with a 
couple things. In the Sept 9 edition of HHD, I read over the article about 
the bug in IE4, which allows people to acces local files from a viewers 
computer.

Well I did a little experimenting with the guy's idea. I looked for a common 
txt file that I know Everyone running Win 95 or 98 would have and I found 
reginfo.txt. It is not nothing Great but if you use this file with a nice 
little perl script you could easily have the users OEM number, OS, NAME, 
Phone number, Address and lots more e-mailed to you directly. Well I just 
thought it was a little neet to see peoples Info popup in my mail box. I've 
created a little 2 lined script with javascrpt that should work, but I'm no 
javascript expert.

[Example]http://outrage.onza.net/local.html

Well, if you have any questions or would like to submit a better use of this 
little bug that BILL GATES and his __________ company didn't find please

 *** Re-initializing hard drives 
================================================================== 
From: "Lester W. Oliver" <les@sactoh0.sac.ca.us>

This is note on FiReWaLL's comment in HHD, Sept. 9, 1998, about 
reinitializing hard drives.

This is an old trick, to 'sort-of' reinitialize IDE hard drives, 
which are running on Mess-DOS/WinDoze machines. It works when 
sector 1 has been scrambled or trashed, and essentially makes the 
drive appear to be factory fresh. After running this routine, you 
will need to repartition with fdisk, and then format the drive.

Boot from drive a: and then start debug. (You do have a handy 
emergency disk ready, right? Go make one.) At the debug prompt, 
enter the following: (Enter after each line)

A 
MOV AX,0301 
MOV BX,0020 
MOV CX,0001 
MOV DX,0080 
INT 13 
(enter) 
G=100 10E

What it does: 
A             start assembly in debug 
MOV AX,0301   write one 512 byte sector 
MOV BX,0020   data address all zeros 
MOV CX,0001   cylinder 0 and sector 1 
MOV DX,0080   head 0 and physical drive 0 (C: is drive 0; an 
              installed D: dirve would be drive 1, and the 
              instruction would be 0081) 
INT 13        interrupt 13 
(enter)       assemble the routine, and return to debug 
G=100 10E     do it to it. run the routine.

If this doesn't work, you can try a 'mid-level' formatting 
program. There are several available from Corporate Systems, and 
Seagate released one several years ago called SGATFMT4. Sorry, I 
don't remember the URL's right now. DON'T ever do a low-level 
format on an IDE drive. That will turn it into a paperweight.

Can't hurt, and beats throwing a "dead" drive at the wall (that 
always scares my cats, then the dogs bark, and.....)

Take care, 
Les

 *** mIRC v5.41 question 
================================================================== 
From: Ciaran <Ciaran.Cooney@independent.ie>

Having just delved into the world of IRC for the first time this 
morning, I have already hit upon a problem....*sigh* 
  
Every time I Join a channel, mIRC executes a DCC send to everyone in 
that channel - a program called ARM311.exe is sent. I've deleted the 
script that mysteriously appeared in the popup menu box which seems to 
relate to it, I've deleted the program and associated file in the mIRC 
directory which it is sending - all to no avail. Upon restarting mIRC 
they all reappear.

Just what the F*CK is going on?

P.S. The happyhacker list is fab. Keep it up.

Reply From: Roger Prata <rprata@yahoo.com>

Hmm, that is VERY interesting.  I have been using mIRC for the past 2 
years, and I have never seen such a thing.  Where did you download it 
from, first of all.  The best (and most reliable) place to download 
mIRC would have to be it's site: http://www.mirc.co.uk.  I would not 
trust an mIRC download from anywhere else...

If anyone else has had this problem, let us know.  It's  a very 
interesting one...

SMTP Relay Checking, what is it, and how do you do it "by hand"?

 *** XM Laroux 
================================================================= 
From: "Jelly.." <jelly@innocent.com>

I've encountered the virus detected by NAV called " XM Laroux". It's 
infected an MS Excel file... But unfortunately NAV can't get rid of it 
except to delete the file.

Do you know of a better idea?

 ***  RE: How to decrypt a win95 password? 
================================================================= 
From: George Reid <george@reid.netkonect.co.uk>

You didn't say what type of Windows password you were trying to crack. I 
presume you mean .PWL (logon) files, in which case the proggie you're 
looking for is called "Glide". Try an AltaVista search and you won't have 
much trouble finding it (versions are available torun under 95/98 and NT).

I don't know why you actually need to decrypt the password - once you're 
logged into the machine, you can delete .PWL files at your own leisure. If 
you want security, try NT!

:-)George

 *** Editorial: Views from InfoWarCon 98 
================================================================= 
From: Dale Holmes <editor@techbroker.com>

Wow! I just spent 14 hours at InforWarCon 98 and I sure am tired...

First of all, I'd like to thank the sponsers of the conference for letting 
me in on a press pass. That was very gracious of them, and I really 
appreciate it.

I met many interesting people while I was at the conference. Hello to all of 
them - they are probably subscribers to the HHD now if they weren't before 
we met. I think the networking that went on between attendees was the most 
valuable thing that happened at the conference.

I saw many presentations at InfoWarCon 98, some good, some bad, and some 
ugly! I will be writing editorials on some of these individually in upcoming 
issues of the Digest.

I got there at 6:30 am and left there at 8:30 PM, and in that 14 hours, I 
took lots of notes, talked to lots of people, and drank lots of coffee - 
lots of coffee! The coffee at the Hyatt Hotel was very good too.

One thing I learned at the conference is that there is no free lunch - 
literally. At least for the press, that is. The conference attendees 
received little yellow meal tickets in order to get into the luncheon room 
where there was an ongoing discussion of "InfoWar - point/counterpoint", or 
something like that, as well as some sort of hot lunch. Well, with my press 
pass, I didn't get any yellow tickets, so I missed that discussion, which I 
really wanted to hear.

Oh well, as someone famous once said, you can't have everything - where 
would you put it?
