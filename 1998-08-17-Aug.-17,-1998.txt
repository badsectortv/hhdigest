 *** Foolproof Win95 Hack! All Versions! 
================================================================== 
From: "inf ormer" <fpinf0rmer@hotmail.com>

Foolproof 3.5 (newest) and earlier.  Windows 95.

Foolproof Security can block access to certain directories in the 
system by 'intercepting interrupt 13h'.  Well, that is not quite true.  To 
access any of the protected directories, simply go into any Office 97 
application and go to the Macro Editor.  From there, you can use the 
CopyFile command, Kill (to delete files), or any other file 
operations.  This allows you full access to the file system.

Foolproof can also disable every application in the system except for 
specified ones that are set in the control panel.  To bypass this 
protection, use macros to overwrite an allowed application, such as 
Publisher 97/98.  Then, you run the application through the shortcut 
that you usually run Publisher from.

As you can see, Foolproof is a little less than foolproof.

 *** Contribution to the digest 
=================================================================== 
From: root <root@nerd.xs4all.nl>

My contribution to your fine magazine, hopefully useful.

First of all the netscape question of last digest. 
All source code of the netscape browsers are free. I know 
there are tools from netscape to make the browser more company 
alike (for companys who bought the browser and want their logo in 
there). It is possible to change the logo. I think it isn't that hard 
to find out at the netscape site.

Second, for all linux and hack newbies, I personally learned a lot 
when I started to read the root/boot howto from linux. It's in all 
distro's. It explains how to create a one or more linux bootdisks. 
A compressed kernel with all your favorite tools on it.

It took a great deal of time to learn how the linux system was put 
together and to create a new filesystem small enough that it fit on one 
floppy. It became my favorite hack tool. Everywhere a network was and 
I knew the ipnumbers used, I booted from my linuxdisk (especially 
school networks).

The kernel had networking in it, handled most used network cards and the 
msdos filesystem.So you could always mount the system you were on. 
A script automatically setup sniffit, tcpdump, telnet and mscan on 
different tty's.Third, you learn a lot with starting to program, just porting 
programs. I'm now working on a port of nmap for windows NT. Nmap is a 
portscanner for linux, you can use about 7 methods of scanning as well as 
the few 
stealth methods known.

On our homepage there are two useful products we wrote for a school 
project. First of all a normal tcp portscanner for Windows NT. Fast and 
reliable. 
It might work under 95/98 but some people reported system lockups :) 
The second is our network/packet analyzer.It is also for Windows NT. 
You have to be administrator to install the packet driver which comes 
with it. Or equal rights or take the rights with the new security leak found in 
NT (http://www.ntshop.net)

Sources are also available. They are both written in CBuilder. The 
source of the sniffer will be soon online. The scanner source is already online. 
Anyway, our url is: http://www.surf.to/hoppa

Bye, keep up the work.

 *** DOS (denial o service) 
================================================================== 
From: Joe Bullock <j.bullock@zianet.com>

I haven't seen any reference to these, so I decided to send an email 
about them to those who don't know what they are.

DOS, or denial of service, are usually commands or shell scripts that 
are not hard to make or do and are used in a malicious manner.

ex: looping

while : ; 
do telnet yada.yada.com 
&done

ex: forwarding using finger

finger @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@.....yada.yada.com

There are many more, and they can get more complicated than these or 
even easier like the ping command.

Adios, 
serialmonkey,(it's not your typical bowl cleaner)

[Dale: The reason you don't see references to DOS attacks is that DOS 
attacks are considered to be lame, and also they are not a nice thing to do...]

 *** Intresting book about hackers, written for eighth graders 
================================================================== 
From: <Rahim10@aol.com>

Dear Editor:

I would like you to publish this in the next HHD. I have found a cool 
book, it's about teenage hackers (good guys by the way). Although this book is 
written for eighth graders it has accurate in depth technical info (It 
actually mentions UNIX telnet, rlogin, dos commands, ftp, ports, ascii, hex, 
coding, ect.).

Well here's the first two chapters of one book so you can decide 
wether it's good enough to publish. There are six books in the series, the first 
two chapters for all of them are avilible at http://cyber.kdz.org (the 
name of the book is Cyber.kdz by the way).

Check it out its really good reading for all the young hackers out 
there who want and interesting book to read. (oh and someone please scan a book 
and post it on the web). And sorry about the bad spelling.

[Dale: Far be it from me to exclude anyone just because they are an 
8th grader. The two chapters attached were too long to print here - you'll just 
have to go to the web site if you're interested... PS- Don't scan a book and 
post 
it to the web unless you own the copyrights - you don't want to deal with the 
publisher's lawyer.]

 *** Why back orifice shouldn't be considered a break through? 
================================================================== 
From: kilbert@juno.com (Nolan aka Kilbert)

This is just my view on why back orifice shouldn't be considered a break 
through. I've been doing some windows and winsock programming recently 
and after I first heard about back orifice I started to think how 
something like that could be implemented. It hit me that it is as simple 
as pie, and that something like it could be made for any operating 
system that supports any form of networking(tcp/ip, ipx, modem-to-modem, etc). 
first off, I have yet to try back orifice, but I really want to so I'm 
still neutral about it sucking or whatever. Second I have nothing 
against the author or the cult of the dead cow. Personally I know very little 
about the cult of the dead cow, other than they are a hacking group 
(am I correct?). hmm...now where to begin. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think i'll go through this by telling how hard certian aspects of the 
program are to implement.

The hardest part to implement probably would be the communications. 
You'd have to decide how you would do it, datagrams or stream, tcp/ip or ipx, 
or a bunch of other odd things. You also have to decide whether or not 
you want them encrypted or not. For back orifice the author chosed udp 
over streams and tcp/ip for internet attacks w/ it.

The second hardest part would probably end up being how to get the 
server onto the computer of interest. Back orifice, as the posting to 
happy hacker says, supports the ability to attach to exe's. That would 
just be a matter of getting some virus attachment code if the author was 
lazy, or some asm coding. It would also require an optimized installation 
routine so the victim doesn't notice anything. Once it is installed the 
program can then start up the server and the attacker can attack if all 
goes well.

Now here's the easier parts since it is pretty much straight forward in 
the windows sdk.

To send a file to the attacker from the host would only require dumping 
the contents of the file to the open connection in the simplest form, 
but I'm sure back orifice allows you to multitask. In that case it would 
open up another port on both computers and send the file through that 
connection.

Now since it is supposed to cause havoc you need the ability to modify 
stuff. To modify the registry it would need to recieve the command to 
tell it to edit the registry and the data to do that. The server would 
probably then parse the data and then call windows' registry functions. 
To delete files and move the around would be fairly easy too. All that 
is required is a move, copy, and delete funtion (I guess that is the bare 
min). The server would need to recieve the command and the filename to 
change and then call one of those functions based on the command that is 
recieved. Now I'm sure the users would want to see the directory 
structure too, so a dir type command would be needed outputing the text 
through the connection.

If the attacker wants to run programs on the attacked machine then it 
would be harder to show apps that use the gui than it would be to 
show console apps(dos). To see what a console app is doing is only a 
matter of rerouting the keyboard and the output. To reroute a gui 
program would be hard, but m$ seems to know how in netmeeting.

Since I decided I better look and see what other features there are I 
will put the rest of the stuff that didn't come off the top of my head 
here. 
The http server isn't super complex either, just a matter of listening 
to http requests on another port and responding accordingly. There are docs 
on http somewhere, and at least in rfcs and the apache src code. 
Connection redirection is probably in an rfc somewhere too, so that's 
avaliable. Sniffers are avaliable as src code too so any one could 
implement that too.

To obtain what the victim sees and does is just a matter of implementing 
a key logger and a screen capture. After they are captured wait until 
the attacker requests them and then send the file to them.

Now to make it completely transperant (not quite true...lag on victims 
input and stuff) is just some optimizations and knowing how windows runs 
programs. I don't know how to make it not show up in the task list, but 
it may have to do w/ it being in the run services entry in the registry. 
Now to support plugins is up to the author of the program. My best guess 
would be to use dlls for them and have some sort of src code released 
(ala quake2's gamex86.dll file).

Now I hope I haven't made this sound like I dislike back orifice, but 
I'm just trying to keep people from getting all hyped up about it being 
something revolutionary. I would say it was revolutionary if it didn't 
need to be installed on the victims computer, but it does. I'm sure I've 
given some people some ideas, like make one for linux or some other OS. 
I'm thinking about trying my own little program like this sometime too. 
To do this in linux or unix type system would probably need a program 
that 
is setuid or run as root.

Just so you people know, I'm speaking hypothetically (my best guess) 
here based on my experience programming windows and winsock which I've 
learned alot over the past few weeks. I may write a follow up on this once I get 
my greedy hands on back orifice, but until then have fun dreaming. I 
also hope this ends up in happy hacker, since there needs to be a nice 
article about more "technical" things other than changing wallpaper; other than 
that it hasn't been too bad.

I also hope the bars I just added help in separting the text some. 
Enjoy!

 *** Re: IP utilities for various OS's 
================================================================== 
From: "DS2 Gene R. Gomez" <grg@essex.navy.mil>

While the list provided by strobe for IP utilities is large, it isn't 
quite as useful as it could be.  I've seen many posts to this list recently 
about UNIX utilities for 95/NT.  Hopefully those of you who are using a 
non-31337 OS like Windows (or those of you who know how to use it just as well 
as the wannabe-31337s do UNIX) aren't using 95.

For NT, many of the utilities listed are already available:

ping (/<winnt_root>/system32/ping.exe) 
nslookup (/<winnt_root>/system32/nslookup.exe) 
tracert (/<winnt_root>/system32/tracert.exe) 
finger (/<winnt_root>/system32/finger.exe) 
telnet (/<winnt_root>/system32/telnet.exe)

Just to mention the ones listed in the post.  In addition, there are a 
LOT of others hiding out in the /<winnt_root>/system32 directory that can be 
used to poke around both a local and a remote machine, including arp, 
ipconfig, ftp, nbtstat, netstat, net, rcp and a whole HOST of others. 
Poke around a bit... I think that you'll be pleasantly surprised about the 
things NT provides for you.

 *** Linux-Security based Mailing list 
================================================================== 
From: tripp@nkn.net

Dear Linux users,

I stumbled across a well of knowledge about 2 months ago, that I think 
every Linux user should consider looking into.  This well is a mailing 
list, Linux-Security based.  Mails go out every day, and they post 
questions about security breeches with Linux, and how to fix them, et 
cetera.  From reading the mail that the list provides, my knowledge on 
Linux has greatly increased.  Here's how yours can too:

Send an e-mail to:   linux-security-request@redhat.com

Leave everything blank except for the subject. 
Write the subject as: 
  
Subscribe

And there you go, I hope that it helps you out as much as it has 
helped me.
