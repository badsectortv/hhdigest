For the floppies:  You need to put the contents of the a[1-6] directories on a 
floppy, one directory apiece

For the HDD:  You don't seem to give enough info for a complete answer, 
but... 
  
 0) Download each of the a? disks into a separate directory, e.g. 
c:\slackware\a?. 
 1) After partitioning, run "setup" 
 2) Say <S>ource 
 3) 1  Install from a hard drive partition 
 4) /dev/hda1 
 5) /slackwar (note the 8 character name) 
 6) Yes 
  
 That should be enough to get you through the part you've been having 
troubles with.

My system never had any problems.  Have you installed the "Disk Type 
Specific Driver Update for Windows 95" upgrade from Microsloth 
<http://www.microsoft.com/windows/download/dsktsupd.exe>?  I have the strong

Simple.  Run RegEdit.  Change stuff till you get interesting results.  Read 
Resource Kit <d:\admin\reskit\helpfile> on the Win95 CD-ROM.

Nope, that’s the desktop after booting.  the file he wants is 
c:\windows\logo[sw].sys.  One is the startup, the other is the shutdown.

Linux & PPP?

I've Recently Put Slackware (Kernel 2.0.26) On My Computer and Have A PPP 
Account With Netcom. I've Tried Many Ways To Set up A PPP Connection With 
Linux But I Can't Get It Done. I Was Wondering Should I Use A Script, 
Minicomm, Or Something Else? If Any Of These The How Would I Get The Job 
Accomplished. 
You May Have Seen Me On IRC at www.infowar.com Asking This Same Question.

I run both fine with Lilo as by boot.  It boots to 95 automatically except 
when I type Linux into Lilo. I dunno what your problem is.  You might need 
to boot Linux and type "pico /etc/lilo.conf" then set the win95 partition 
as the first partition to boot then when you exit and type "lilo" you 
should be OK.

OK A not so quick Piece of info about Linux living inside of a Win95 
system.... 
# 1. You have to repartition your hard drives to make room for Linux and its 
swap file. 
There are currently 3 way's to do this.. 
    A. You can Backup your entire Drive that you intend on installing Linux 
on and then Fdisk it and create 3 new separate partitions. 1 for Win95 to 
reside in 1 for The Linux system itself and finally 1 for the Linux Swap 
file <tip the swap file size should be approx. twice the size of your 
physical Ram onboard>. Now You need to set the Win95 Partition as a Primary 
active partition that is Where you will boot from. The two remaining 
partitions should be left unformatted at this point since if you format them 
using DOS’s Fdisk Then You will only have to delete them and reformat with 
Linux anyway.... The next step is to <tip 2 You should have created a Boot 
disk Before you Fdisked the system so that once you formatted it you can 
Reinstall The System and Files that you previously backed up> <Tip 3 Unless 
you know what a partition is and how to use Fdisk, Backup, And create a 
Master Boot Record Then you may as well hang it up and move on down to 2 or 
3> 
    B. After you have restored the Win95 system to the Primary bootable 
partition of your system and Managed to Boot the system you will get two 
sets of errors... They will say that Drive <so and so> and Drive <so and 
so> Don’t appear to be valid drives but will have icons listed in the My 
computer folder. This is because if you followed the above instructions 
they are unformated drives and Cant be used by Win95.. your next step is 
<did I mention that you needed to create A Linux boot disk and root 
disk<ramdisk before you could install them?> There are hundreds of 
resources available on the Net that explain in Complete detail how to do 
that.... Just load your browser and type Installing Linux... :-)  You 
should be at the point now where you have your Linux boot disk and root 
disk handy and just need to reboot the computer with the Linux Boot disk in 
Drive A. It will then go through a series of checks and start readying the 
system for the Kernel install.. After that is complete it will ask you for 
your Ramdisk <root disk> and you change disks and install the root disk and 
press enter and it then starts umcompressing the Linux kernel installing it 
and gives you a Login prompt... at the login prompt you need to do a 
variety of things depending on the particular version of Linux you are 
installing... Most of the time you will just type Login:root when it asks 
for password you just press enter and it should log you into the system at 
that point... if it says something like invalid password then you need to 
read the install instructions with the version you have it may make you 
type Login:root Password:root Once again that is version specific... now if 
you are logged in then Congrats your 1/3 of the way to installing the 
system. 
   C. Now is when you Are going to hide the previously unformated drives 
from Win95 so that it cant see them...:-) At the prompt you simply type 
fdisk. It will then say something like Fdisk Defaulting to /dev/hda. which 
should be the drive that you intend on installing Linux to and also the 
drive that Win95 resides on as well... Now if you are going to be 
installing to a different drive than you would have to tell it which 
primary drive that you are going to need to Format like this..

Fdisk /dev/hda    Where hda is your 1st physical hard drive 
Fdisk /dev/hdb    Where hdb is your second physical hard drive 
Fdisk /dev/hdc    Where hdc is your third physical hard drive 
Fdisk /dev/hdd    Where hdd is your forth physical hard drive

Now notice that these are not labeled as C:,D:,E:,F: That is because your 
physical drives and your Logical drives could be very different Take my 
system for example I have This setup: 
/dev/hda 1st physical drive 
  /dev/hda1 1st logical drive    Dos C: drive 
  /dev/hda2 2nd logical drive   Dos D: drive 
  /dev/hda3 3rd logical drive    Linux Native EXT2 drive 
So I have 3 partitions on My /dev/hda drive 2 for Dos and 1 for Linux 
I also have the following: 
/dev/hdb 2nd physical drive 
  /dev/hdb1 1st logical drive  Dos E: drive 
  /dev/hdb2  2nd logical drive Linux Swap drive 
/dev/hdc 3rd physical drive 
  /dev/hdc1 1st logical drive Dos F: drive 
  /dev/hdc2 2nd logical drive Dos G: drive 
  /dev/hdc3 3rd logical drive Dos H: drive 
And finally since I am using a IDE ATAPI CDROM that is connected to My 
Secondary IDE cable I have: 
 /dev/hdd   Cdrom

That should give you the idea as to what is necessary now So when I had to 
format my Linux Partitions that I created I did the following things: 
Fdisk <enter> 
Fdisk is defaulting to /dev/hda 
Then I typed m to get a listing of available commands <help> 
The four main commands that you will be interested in are: 
d   deletes a partition 
n   adds a partition 
p   prints the partition tables 
w  writes the table to disk 
What you have to do is decide where your Linux swap partition and Main 
Linux data File partitions are going to be located and format them 
accordingly. In my case Main Linux File partition was /dev/hda3 so I did 
the following: 
p <enter> 
Which gave me a listing of Partitions that are currently in use on /dev/hda 
and there respective begin start end blocks id and system types and whether 
or not is was a boot partition. I then did this: 
n  <enter> 
Command Action  <--- This was the output by Fdisk 
 e extended          <--- 
 p primary (1-4)     <--- to which I typed 
p <enter> 
Fdisk then asked which partition number I wanted to create. If you enter a 
number that already exists then Fdisk says that you have to delete it first 
and then create it <tip Remember That Listing I told you to get above Well 
don’t use any of those numbers if they say Dos cause they are your Win95 
system also you should have and I repeat should have not Formatted The 
partitions that you intended to use for Linux when you repartitioned your 
Hard drive with the Dos Fdisk Proggie that is what we are doing now :-) > So 
I replied : 
3 <enter> 
p <enter> 
At this point I should see that I now have the following partition table 
listed Shortened  cause this is already to long... 
Device       ********************************* System 
/dev/hda1     *****************************    Dos 16-bit 
/dev/hda2    ******************************    Dos 16-bit 
/dev/hda3    ******************************    Linux Native 
Next we type the following: 
w <enter> 
And fdisk then writes the changes to your hard disk and Dumps you out to the 
Login prompt after saying that you have to reboot for the changes to take 
effect but we aren’t done yet still have to create and format the Swap 
partition too.... Like this: 
Fdisk /dev/hdb <enter> 
p <enter> to see what the table looks like and the numbers of the used 
Primaries 
n <enter> to create the Swap file partition 
p <enter> in response to the Primary or extended formatting we need to do 
2 <enter> Since this is the second partition on the existing drive 
t <enter> here is a new command it tells Linux what reference to apply to 
the partition we just created based on the following response we are going 
to give it. 
82 <enter> 82 tells Fdisk that we are creating a Linux Swap partition 
p <enter> to print the table out and verify the changes we want made 
and finally: 
w <enter> to write them to disk

OK I left out a few things too First off the sizes of the partitions are 
strictly up to you but for a basic No frills Linux install you can get by 
with 120 meg Main file partition and a Swap file that is twice the size of 
your physical Ram on board< I have 32 megs of Ram so I made my swap file 64 
megs in size>. I also Set aside 300 megs for my Main file partition for 
Linux Because I planned on using Xfree86 the Xwindows system that runs 
under Linux..... It took 120 megs of space with all the bells and whistles 
added :) At this point you should have created the needed partitions for 
Linux and also have hidden them from Win95s sight to prevent Win95 from 
complaining about them :-) Now all you have to do is install what ever 
package of Linux that you have Be it Slackware, Redhat, etc... Usually all 
you have to do is this: 
Install <enter> 
Then follow the instructions from there :)

2.  Use a experimental Proggie that is usually included with most Linux 
systems called Fips which allows you to partition your hard drives without 
destroying any of the existing data on your hard drives.... Although it is 
still recommended that you Create a Set of backups just in case you make a 
mistake :-) There are very complete and concise instructions with the Fips 
package on how to do this so I wont make a already to long Post about the 
wherefores and how to's.... :-) 
after you do the repartitioning you just follow the above instructs for 
booting the Linux system and Creating the Linux Partitions and Formatting 
them...

3. <my personally recommended Method> Get Partition Magic From 2.0 up 
they all are very stable and very easy to use cost $40 Savings in hair 
pulling and possibility of making a major mistake Much reduced..... 
Basically it is a graphically mapped representation of your hard drive that 
allows you to tweak everything from the Partitions to the Cluster sizes 
without having to destroy your data the advantages become clear when say 
you have a 1 gig plus hard drive and are losing about 40% of your hard drive 
space due to the 32k clusters that you are using to store a 1k file for 
example most of your smaller .ini files or text files anything under 32k in 
size automatically becomes a 32k cluster in space on your hard drive start 
adding all those small files up and the wasted space becomes clearer to 
you... There is a very complete and concise book that comes with the 
Program so explaining the process here is also not necessary but the 
important thing to remember is Not and I repeat Once again to NOT format or 
set active the partitions that you intend on creating for Linux You do that 
from the Linux Prompt that you receive once you put the Boot and Root disks 
into the system and Then follow the above section 1 instructions for 
Formatting the Linux Partitions.....

NOT AFRAID OF NARCS

From: Mjolnir <Mjolnir@thor.pla-net.net>

Hacking is gaining information.  Hacking is not "Well I had better not 
do that, its ILLEGAL."  I don't care if every single FBI agent in the US 
is reading this group, I would think they have bigger fish to fry than 
someone who says "I want to hack my ISP."  I thought my hard earned tax 
dollars are going to help the FBI track down hard core criminals.  Yes, 
someone out there may put this information to malevolent use, but that 
happens.  Is this a mailing list for hacking discussion or setting up 
UNIX?  If someone asks a question, give them a straight answer.  Don't 
say "you may be an accessory if he does something illegal."  This type 
of responce is not a Happy Hacker response, its a "computer trickster" 
response.  Yes some of these things may be illegal, but I challenge any 
law enforcement official reading this letter to tell me that they would 
track my email address and arrest me if I answered a question on how to 
hack a system.

Moderator: You’re right, so long as you don’t cause harm you aren’t too likely to get caught. But -- some people do wind up in jail for relatively harmless pranks. Kevin Mitnick is an example. Apparently his three biggest mistakes were eavesdropping on FBI agents, reading the email of _New York Times_ reporter John Markoff, and making a hacker/phreaker (Tsutomo Shimomura) mad at him.

The best way of all to wind up in jail for computer crime is to make hackers mad at you. Oh, you think a hacker won’t narc on you? Look at Shimomura. That’s also how the Masters of Destruction got caught -- they p***** off the Legion of Doom. So guess who it was that gathered enough evidence to bust the MOD? Yes, it was the LOD. Five MOD guys were convicted: Phiber Optic (Mark Abene), Outlaw (Julio Fernandez), Corrupt (John Lee), Acid Phreak (Elias Ladopoulos) and Scorpion (Paul Stira).

Now Eric Bloodaxe (Chris Goggins) -- the LOD guy who did the most to bust the MOD -- is a revered hacker, a successful consultant, and author of the book _The Complete Internet Business Toolkit_ which you can find in almost any bookstore. It comes with a CD-ROM full of  kewl Windows hacking tools. At hacker conventions you can buy a T-shirt with the slogan “I only hack for money -- Eric Bloodaxe.”

So if you are going to break into a computer, just remember that the sysadmin of that box may well be a hacker. Or, the owner may hire a hacker to help bust vandals. If you damage his or her system, you could be in for BIG trouble.

Watch and see what happens to GALF. With their file wiping blunders they’re way down the same path as the MOD. Remember: don’t hack hackers! Oh, by the way, it’s not wise to email bomb hackers, either...heh, heh...make my day...

Do you know what really pisses me off? Everyone is trying to tell 
everyone else what hacking is supposed to be. Some say pheaking is not 
hacking, some deny that IRC hacking is not true hacking, others claim 
UNIX hacking is the only real hacking. 
And then there is this whole "social engineering" thing. 
Who cares what is real hacking and what is not. Is everyone waiting for 
an Oxford Dictionary definition of what is and is not allowed to be 
labeled hacking? 
Most of us are in this game because of our love of computers and a 
certain rebellious spirit that tells us to do things others have no idea 
could be done, let alone how to do them. 
We seek to learn new things and new ways of doing old things. Does it 
really matter whether you hack UNIX via a modem, Win95 at a box or IRC. 
Or any of the millions of other things this large and DIVERSE community 
gets up to.

From: pmurgs@aztec.co.za (P. Murgatroyd)

Caroline, are you stupid or really stupid?

The guy below was asking about the 95 startup screen and he seemed to make 
that pretty clear then you go off talking about W95 backgrounds.

The file he wants to change is c:\logo.sys which is hidden/system/read-only. 
Its 320x200x8. c:\windows\logow.sys is the 95 "please wait" shutdown screen 
and c:\windows\logos.syst is the "It is safe..." shutdown screen.

Caroline... you really s***.

Moderator: Gee, well on my Win95 operating system, the startup screen uses the same file as the background screen. But I suppose it is possible that other versions of Win95 are not set up to do this. All I can say is I do what works. Isn’t that what hacking is?
