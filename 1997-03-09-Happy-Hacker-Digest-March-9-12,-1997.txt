FROM THE MODERATOR/s: SETTING UP LINUX 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 
Ruben says: Nothing feels better than the surge of happiness after 
a major accomplishment. That's exactly the feeling I got after I 
installed linux on my pc box.

Thanks to the shared knowledge of the HH community, I got bold 
enough to borrow my friend's Infomagic CD and ask him some stupid 
questions. He recommended RedHat because he said it's easier to 
install.

Now, I recommend RedHat to all the other newbies here. I planned on 
narrating my whole experience, but as you'll see from the messages 
below, others have done a better job. So I've relegated myself to a 
few inserted comments when I felt like giving my 2- cents worth.

Meanwhile, we're trying to improve the readability of the digest. Help 
us do this by (1) quoting relevant msgs clearly (that is, select and 
quote the specific text you are responding to), and (2) by sending us 
you rants and raves about the digest.

Here's to a better mental shareware!

GETTING AND INSTALLING LINUX 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- 
<1: get redhat linux> 
From: Bernz <bernz@ix.netcom.com>

"Jeffrey Steinbrecher" darkling69@hotmail.com asked this 
question:

   >I have a win95 laptop, and am looking to double boot linux 
   on it. I >have no idea where to find linux, and only a rough 
   idea on how to >get it working.

Bernz answers:

When i was interested in getting linux, i had the same problem. 
I bought RedHat Linux Unleashed (from SAMS publishing). It is 
bundled with a really nice linux cd that has plenty of stuff on 
it to get you started. It also comes with LILO (read: "lie low"). 
That's a boot system for linux that enables you to run multiple OS's. 
The book tells you how to set it all up.

You're going to need to partition your drive. In order not to 
erase your 95 stuff, you have to use FIPS or another partitioning 
utility. The book explains this all in detail. The point? Get yourself 
a linux book and cd and just follow the instructions. 
 

benc says: RedHat has a neat install facility that steps you 
through the whole process. It's CD number 2 in the Infomagic set. 
You'll need three blank disks - one for the installation boot disk, 
and two ramdisks. Everything is written on the readme files and if you 
know how to read ;) you ought to get it done easily. The partitioning 
wasn't as difficult as I expected. After you step through the whole 
process, you will be prompted on where to boot LILO - hard disk or 
floppy. I chose floppy because I heard win95 doesn't work well with 
LILO.

<2: ftp and web sites for linux> 
Sender: abszero@epix.net

Linux can be gotten from many ftp sites all over the place.  I 
use the closest mirror of sunsite.unc.edu, since that mirror is 
at my isp.  For a complete list of offical mirrors of sunsite, 
look at  http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/hmirrors.html.  The other 
major linux ftp is tsx-11.mit.edu.  Both have several complete 
distributions of linux in the directory/pub/linux/distributions.  I 
use slackware, but RedHat and debian are highly recomended. All of the 
subdirectories of distributions should have README files, I suggest 
you read them. 
 

"Timothy Ward" ward@carl.all-net.net advises:

... the best place to get the o.s. is from linux systems labs. 
www.lsl.com I think.  They have a cd rom with three verions, 
slackware 3.1, debian 1.2.5, and Red Hat 4.1 for $2.95.  Yes, you can 
get most or all of it for free from various ftp spots, but having it 
all in one place helps tremendously.  Also, I recommend a book on 
linux.  I like one called "Linux unleashed".  if you get one of these 
books, usually they give you a cd rom with it, so there's no need to 
buy it.

From: Robert Kennedy  <robk@hyperion.dynanet.com>

Hey there.

For anyone wanting to learn a bit about Linux, just go to this 
site: http://www.dynanet.com/~robk/linux.html I put this site 
together for the channel i started on IRC. The channel is 
#Linux on the starlink server. I have just started using linux 
and there are lots of places to get it from: local `puter stores, mail 
order, downloads, friends, etc. See ya!

benc's 2-cents worth: don't be lazy guys ;) Search the web for 
linux and you'll get a wealth of info.

LILO PROBLEMS 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
From: "Stephen James" <sjamesflorida-wellington@worldnet.att.net>

For some reason LILO can't detect my first or second hard drive 
when the second hard drive is installed.  I have to remove 
/dev/hdb to get Slackware Linux to work.  It confuses the 
parameters (thinks both drives hda and hdb have 176 physical 
heads) and refuses to boot the system properly.  The error code 
LILO gives me is 0x80.

Can somebody give some info on how to fix this problem or tell 
me where I can get the info myself.

Many thanks for your time,

Stephen James

ANSWERS TO A PINE QUESTION 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

prata@boss1.bossnt.com asked this question: 
I am using Minicom with pppd to connect to my isp.  Now, I have a 
shell acct on my isp's Linux box.  I use Pine when I telnet to that 
box. Is it possible to use MY Pine to send and receive email from a 
remote box when connected through ppp?? I tried setting it up, but it 
doesn't seem to work.

"James Mastros" abszero@epix.net answers back: 
Once you have pine set up, you need to run a program to retrieve 
your mail from your isp.  Slackware (and other distributions I 
assume) come with popclient on the N series.  I made a quick 
"wrapper" for popclient called getmail:

popclient -a -K -u abszero -p imnotteling -o $MAIL 
mailhost.epix.net $*

this will do the following: 
-a:  get all of the mail waiting on epix (my isp)

-K:  delete the retrived mail from epix after geting it

-u abszero:  login to epix's mail server with the name 
  "abszero", instead of root

-p imnotteling:  give the password imnotteling to the mailhost 
(puting your password on the command line might be a security 
risk, since it would be visible with ps.

-o $MAIL:  put the mail in the local mailbox of the 
user that is running = the script.

mailhost.epix.net:  the name of epix's mailhost $*:  if I gave 
any arguments to getmail, give them to popclient here.

put that script in /usr/local/bin, and chmod it u+x (or a+x to 
allow anyb= ody to get the mail, useful if you have one remote 
mailbox for everobody that has access to your computer (big fat 
security risk).

  -- James Mastros

NB: you will get lots of blank messages from "POPClient" this 
way.  If you know how to get rid of these, please e-mail me at 
abszero@epix.net.

  -- James Mastros 
 

Charlie ROOT <root@ruined.all-net.net> answers back too:

To the Pine questioner: 
You may want to see if your ISP support's POP mail. If so you 
can use the utility "popclient" provided with most Linux 
distributions to get the mail from your server and you can put 
it in any mail folder in your spool, and then use pine to mail 
it. As for mailing FROM your box, Sendmail may want to be a 
meanie and not let you unless you're STATIC, in which case you 
may have to do it from your ISP. 
 

Timothy Ward 
ward@carl.all-net.net

P.S. if you have a static IP, a .forward in your ~/ on your ISP 
will forward your mail to ya, barring the need for popclient.

STILL IN SEARCH OF INDENTD 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
From: "M.Falsetti aka 1NV3rNoMu+0" 
<inverno.muto@bbs.infosquare.it>

I've been experimenting with IDENTD and SMTP as outlined in 
k1netik's post at www.infowar.com.

What I found is:

1) if you comment out auth line in /etc/inetd.conf, no SendMail 
will be able to achieve your name via SMTP on port 25 (BUT you 
could be traced with msgID of receiver - see 4)

2) if you put in the same file, in the same line the -n 
parameter, SendMail will get the user number instead of the user 
name (see man identd)

3)if you put -N and a .noidentd in home dir, SendMail's gonna 
get HIDDEN USER instead of real name

4)if you create a user called whoUlookingat, identd will pass 
this to SendMail

BUT THE REAL PROBLEM, IMHO, is that on slip and ppp running 
Linux, we get the ISP IP assignement along with its name 
as set in ISP's LAN aliases file -- e.g. in my case, 
linexxx.infosquare.it (with xx being a number between 10 and 
255) ...... SO:

5)SendMail will usually report Received from: 
name{identd(y/n)}@isp.dynamicip.name 
ALONG WITH THE REAL  IP NUMBER !!! if the receiver email proggy 
supports FULL HEADER  .....

6) IP number is not identified through IDENTD which applies 
for user names only. Anyone knows how this is achieved and 
eventually countermeasured?

7)if we got DIRECT CONNECTION or SHELL on a DIRECT LINK instead 
of a slip/ppp (even if linux or other flavours), we can specify 
OUR hostname as we like it to appear, say hell.micro$oft.com, 
and this should be taken seriously by the SendMail ALTHOUGH the 
REAL IP number would be identified .... but inexperienced 
users wouldn't look so closely at IP numbers in the Received 
field, but only at hostname. POINT 7 ONLY IF THERE'S NO 
WAY TO WORK AROUND POINT 6

further infos, discussion and help appreciated ........

invy

benc's 2-cents worth: hi invy! Like I said in a previous post, if 
you're logging on from a modem, all your activities are traceable to 
the modem port you are using, no matter what anonymous tricks you do. 
You have a point in item 7 though. (In fact I already tried that). 
Even then, as you said, your IP is still embedded, and will appear on 
the header no matter what you do. Short of sneaking into a direct-net 
computer and sending your anonymous msg, there really is no way. You 
can only fool newbies or those too lazy to trace anonymous mail. Don't 
get me wrong, however. I think there are times when we need to send 
anonymous mail and like you, i am perpetually in search of those 
methods.

VIEWING PASSWORDS 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

in a previous hacker digest, someone asked:

>   Now how do I view this pwd.db file? I tried Paradox 5 but it 
>   said the file's header is corrupted.

pete@servtech.com replies:

Well, that probably holds the passwords, and from the suffix it 
looks like a database file. Does your Unix box have any database 
software installed? (I don't know of any Unix database stuff. 
Anyone out there?) Or, if you have Acess or other high-end 
databse software on your computer, you could try importing it.

>   Another thing: in the passwd file all of the users have " 
>   :*: " as their password. How do I find out their password? 
>   One of the users also has no password " :: " but when I try 
>   to login as that user, the system asks for a password.

The *s mean that the passwords are shadowed, for better 
security. (There have been other posts on that subject, so I 
won't grind it into the ground.) For the no password user, try 
just hitting return, or if it's a default user -- like bin, sys, 
admin, etc-- try using the default password for that account. 
You can get a list in one of the newbie philes on Infinity Void 
(I forget which) but it's out there.

Hope that helps!

WINHACK: NT QUESTIONS 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
From: Clarky <clarky@Klink.Net>

Ok heres the scenario... 
The person who runs the library at my school is an evil witch 
who likes to spoil fun. When me and my friend got busted for 
using the network for a game of Quake she said that us "hackers" 
would never be let back in, ever again!

Time passed and we where not even allowed even near the library 
entrance. But now that the windows NT network is up she said that if 
we could hack her network and show her how we did it that she would 
let us back in.  Us, being labeled as the elite of the school took it 
as a welcome challenge.  BUT here is where the trouble starts. She has 
the disk WRITE PROTECTED. And since debug wont work properly with the 
permissions set like they are we cant do anything with that either. 
We tried for hours.. we even tried pinging down the server at no 
avail.  WE NEED YOUR HELP.. give us any ideas you have please!!!

Carolyn: A likely story. But I'll assume you're telling the 
truth and I won't get busted for contributing to the delinquency 
of a minor.

Do you have physical access to the file server on this network? 
That would simplify things. Then my suggestion is that you need 
to edit the registry. If you can edit the registry you can gain 
access to ANYTHING on the network. If you can't edit the registry on 
the file server, try the registry of any other box on the network, and 
see if from their you cna get administrative privileges. Maybe I'm 
asking for flames, but it is my humble opinion that if you can gain 
access to the registry, this is equivalent to gaining root on a Unix 
box. Any half-way decent Windows 95 or NT manual should give details 
about editing the registry. I like the registry editing instructions 
in _Secrets of Winodws 95_, _Windows NT Workstation 4.0_ and _Peter 
Norton's COmplete Guide to Windows NT 4 Workstation_.

WINHACK: ACCESSING PROGRAMS FROM A WEB PAGE

previously, a hacker posted this:

"Xenakis" xenakis@epix.net answers back: 
I believe that you mean <A HREF="file|/c://whatever">Whatever</A> I 
already had one at my site for a while....click on this link: <A HREF 
= "file://C:\Windows\Notepad.exe">Notepad</A> or if you use Notepad to 
do your site, try puting this HTML in your page:

<A HREF = "file://C:\Windows\Notepad.exe"><IMG HEIGHT = 57

WINHACK: CAN'T FIND LOGO.SYS!

Sender: Alexei02@POboxes.com

Hello-

I was trying to do your first newbie hacker trick for Win95, but 
I can't get the logo.sys file to show up.  I am following the 
directions very carefully and it will not show.  It skips from 
io.sys to msdos.. or something.  I don't know whats going on or 
why its not working.  Please help me.

Carolyn replies: In some versions of Windows 95 there is no 
logo.sys, only io.sys. But naming your graphic logo.sys still 
works (I know because I did it with one of those systems.) I 
found some info that says only Microsoft Plus versions of Win95 
have logo.sys.

I WAS HACKED ON IRC! 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
From: Nathan <nathanp@worldchat.com>

Hey list. I was sitting in IRC when some idiot came into the 
channel swearing and so-on so I kicked him out.  When i tried to 
get online later that night i couldn't, after calling my ISP i 
discovered that this guy has hacked into some server under MY 
username.  How did he do this and how can i prevent him from 
getting ANY info from me in IRC.  You guys gotta be careful, my 
ISP killed my account and i'm now trying to explain myself to 
them.  I was one of the two people who got hacked and i wanna 
know how to stop em!

Thanks

Nathan Poole

benc replies: hey list questioner! :) are you sure you didn't put your 
real account name or email address on your chat client?

There are several details you haven't told us. Did he hack 
servers in your isp or another server altogether? How was the 
attack done and discovered by your isp?

Since I don't know much about the details and am a newbie too, 
this is what he possibly did:

First, he did a /whois on you. This returned info on you, like 
your IP address, and if you put your real name or email address, those 
things too.

In which case he either fingered your email address and found 
more details on you, logged on to your isp, cracked your password and 
spoofed you.

Why to Get a Computer Science/Math Degree 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
From: Keith Bostic <bostic@bostic.com> 
Subject: Sometimes life *does* imitate morality plays. 
Forwarded-by: Dave Barr <barr@math.psu.edu> 
From: "Elizabeth D. Zwicky" <zwicky@neu.sgi.com>

Long ago and far away I shared a house with two other 
programmers. One of them was a starving college student, and the 
other one was a highly-paid computer consultant with no 
theoretical background.

One day, the starving college student bounght a copy of 
"Algorithms". This is a beautiful hardcover full of comp sci 
stuff that cost at the time rough $60, which was approximately 
$59.99 more than the disposable income he had available. The 
highly-paid computer consultant thought this was the dumbest 
concept he had ever heard of. 8 different ways to sort things! 
Why, anybody could sort things!

The very next weekend, we went down into the basement where the 
computers were to ask the highly-paid computer consultant if 
he'd like to go to a movie. "Well," he said "I can't go right 
now, maybe in a couple of hours, I need to do something as soon 
as this finishes.  The odd thing is, I thought it would be done 
by now." "What's it doing?" says the starving college student, 
and receives the explanation that the pointers have gotten 
corrupted for the doubly-linked list that makes up the entire 
customer database for one of the consultant's important clients, 
and he is traversing the database, sorting it back into order. 
With an insertion sort. He's traversing them in creation order, 
which means that they are in fact about 75% in final order.  The 
reason he thought he'd be done by then is that he watched it do 
the first 20 items, and multiplied the time to do that by the 
size of the database.

The starving college student whipped out a pocket calculator and 
calculated the time necessary to do the sort, using an algorithm 
which in this situation approaches O(n!) and that exclamation 
point is *not* for emphasis boys and girls, and pointed out that 
indeed we might as well all go to the movie since it was going 
to finish no sooner than midnight Sunday night and it was then 
2:00 on Saturday afternoon, we had plenty of time. The 
highly-paid computer consultant hung on grimly until the bitter 
end, which was in fact 4am Monday, before admitting that maybe, 
just maybe, there was some point in knowing more than one sort 
algorithm.

The truly sad point here, which some of you may have noticed, is 
that it was a doubly-linked list and the data was mostly in 
final order; simply reversing the order in which he traversed 
the already sorted data would have changed it from near O(n!) 
performance to near O(n) performance without requiring him to 
learn a new algorithm at all. Increase in programming time: 5 or 
10 minutes tops. Decrease in run time: call it 36 hours. As it 
happens, his resulting loss was not just his Saturday afternoon 
amusement, but also about 20 billable hours, and very nearly his 
major client. All because he didn't know that how you sort 
things matters.

Sometimes life *does* imitate morality plays.

RANTS: DO SOME READING! 
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
<anonymous>

GRRRRR!  OK, Listen UP!  Go to your local bookstore.  Get one of 
the 10,ooo+ books, with CDROM (oooh, it's soooo shiny!), on 
Win95.  Get one that sez "For Dummies".  Get one that sez "For 
Idiots" (yeah, with f'n Cliff Claven on the cover!).  Get one 
that sez "Unleashed".  Then Learn to read.  Open the manuals 
that came with your stupid OS.  Open the God D**N Readme files! 
READ THEM!!  You should have ALREADY learned how to make a 
tricky flashing ANSI Charset Color prompt in DOS before you even 
THINK of getting anywhere on the net.  Cuz THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES! 
If you don't have the guts, stamina, and balls (or ovaries) to 
tweak your own system into hell and bring it back alive, how 
could you hope to take root on someone else's?  Or to figure out 
your own exploits.  Tell you what, when you can crash your OWN 
system at will and ressurect it intact, then you can come out 
here and make a name for yourself instead of running the same 
old exploits again and again and bitching about how they don't 
work.  Win95 has NO CONCEPT of taking root.  Just reboot the 
f***er.  Hold down F8, and the box is yours.  Now, how do you 
get root on a UNIX flavor? (and which flavor do you want?) 
Thars a question WORTHY of someone who rules their own system 
and wants to taste of power and knowledge of another's.  Just 
send your WinCrap Hell/Baitway300 back to th' factory and find 
your local community college.  You'll get farther, and no-one 
calls you a "newbie".  Just a Freshman.

L8tR

Carolyn: You're going to hate me for this.  F8 doesn't always 
work. To secure your Windows 95 box from this attack, put the 
statement Bootkeys=0 in the msdos.sys file.

But to circumvent this fix, reboot the computer with a boot disk 
in the a: drive, and then edit the bootkeys statement. Then 
reboot and press F8. Then simply delete every file that ends 
with the extension "pwl." Tha eliminates all passwords. Then 
when you reboot into Win95, when the password dialog box comes 
up, just hit enter and you're in.

If the computer won't boot from the a: drive, then you need to 
go into the cmos setup at the very beginning of the startup 
process and reset the default boot drive to a:.

If there is a password required to reset the cmos ... I don't 
know the answer to that one!

benc says: yes Carolyn. open the cpu and remove the CMOS battery. this 
messes up everything, but hey, it erases the password! then, you can 
just autodetect the hard disks.
