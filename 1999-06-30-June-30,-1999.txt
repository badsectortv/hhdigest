 *** What Happened to the Happy Hacker IRC Server? 
_______________________________________________________________________

By mutual agreement with Schematic, we have taken down the Happy Hacker IRC 
server.  Another volunteer who has more of a taste for the thankless job of 
coordinating the moderators will be providing a new computer to handle the 
job.  We thank Schematic and his fellow moderators for managing to keep the IRC 
server reasonably flame free for so long so people could use it for learning 
about white hat hacking.

Unfortunately, the people at http://attrition.org have run a news story on our 
IRC server which is seriously misinformed.

Most importantly, that story claims that the Happy Hacker IRC server was a 
public server.  This is not true.  If you go to http://networksolutions.net you 
can look up who runs Happyhacker.org.  Click on "whois search" on the left hand 
menu.  When you ask about happyhacker.org, you will see that Chris at 
sage-inc.com is the technical contact, and I (Carolyn Meinel) am the 
administrative contact.  What that means is we are NOT a public utility of some 
sort that people can use and abuse as they see fit.  We provide the War Room 
and T1, and we decide how our resources will be used.

Also, the Attrition.org article was quite insulting to John Vranesevich. 
However, he was only telling the truth when he reminded the Happyhacker.org IRC 
moderators that they needed to do a better job of handling people when they 
behaved badly.  If we want talented hackers to visit our IRC server and train 
people for free, we need to treat everyone politely.  If we run the place like 
a barroom brawl, soon only trash will hang out on our IRC server.

In general, anything that makes lots of people raise a big fuss will cause us 
to take action.  It isn't easy getting support for our operation.  Price out 
renting a 20x15 office and a T1 and you will see what we must deal with.  We 
could easily be totally shut down, with no notice, if our backers ever decide 
Happyhacker.org isn't worth their support.  In fact, we won't support Happy 
Hacker, either, unless we beleive this is a worthwhile project.  Imagine that!

We are the only public wargame that allows winners to keep control of our 
Internet hosts.  There is a BIG reason that we are the only ones.  It is 
because we work hard to avoid even the appearance of promoting crime and 
especially juvenile crime.  To do this we must behave politely and treat those 
who support our activities just as well as we would treat anyone else.

So where can you go to get a public IRC channel where people talk about our 
Hacker Wargame?  Try #koan on Undernet.  While this channel, too, is moderated, 
it is not moderated by us.  So if you don't like how it is run, don't flame 
us!  It is still up and none of us at Happyhacker.org have any plans to 
interfere with it. Happyhacker.org has never moderated that channel and never 
intends to moderate it.

For those who don't like to waste time waiting for flaming to end and teaching 
to begin on #koan on Undernet, we will have our IRC server back up soon, with a 
different set of moderators.

 *** Wargame Improvements Coming Up 
_______________________________________________________________________

We've had a lot of complaints about koan.happyhacker.org being down most of the 
time.  Unfortunately none of the Wargame players were able to fix the denial of 
service attack problems that kept on crashing it.  So some of the Wargame 
administrators will be rebuilding it so you can have fun again with the guest 
account with the really stupid password.  Meanwhile, you can still have fun by 
telnetting into thirdpig.com, and attacking our Happy Hacker Web server. 
Meyer.happyhackr.org is still running its popular beta account, and the Cisco 
router, dmz.happyhacker.org, still lets you in if you can guess its password 
that is fined up beyond all recognition.

Happy hacking!

 *** Looking for a Mentor?  Try Foomentor! 
_______________________________________________________________________

From: "ForEver Phreaker" <forever@phreaker.net> 
Subject: New Mailing List.

Hey Carolyn, I am just sending you a short note to tell you about a new mailing 
list I am starting for newbie hackers, It's in the same spirit as HappyHacker 
and I thought that you could possibly mention it in one of the digests or if 
anyone writes to you looking for a mentor, the mailing list will be named 
FooMentor and is just basically a cut down version of the happy hacker list 
mainly aimed but not completely towards Windows Users. I already have a few 
people I am 'Mentoring' who are interested. If you wish to include it in any 
digests then please feel free.

 *** Hacker Friendly Shell Accounts! 
_______________________________________________________________________

Having trouble finding a mentor? Do you want to learn how to use a Unix type 
operating system?   Do you want tech support from the man who first created 
Koan.happyhacker.org and its infamous guest account with the really stupid 
password?  Want someone to help you big time with playing the Hacker Wargame? 
We soon will open an Internet Service Provider (Techbroker.com) running on an 
OpenBSD (a type of Unix) server and offering shell accounts.  Of course we will 
NOT train people in computer crime.  But we are happy to teach people the 
basics of legal, harmless hacking.

True, some people think someone should give them free shell accounts and free 
one-on-one training in hacking. There are lots of places to look for this sort 
of free stuff.  However, normally hackers get really, really nasty when someone 
comes around begging for free stuff and not offering anything in return.  I 
have had great experiences by first making friends, then giving them copies of 
my books, taking them out for pizza, that sort of thing.

However, not everyone is lucky enough to find a mentor, no many how pizzas you 
buy.  Even if you do find a mentor, I have nevertheless often paid money for 
shell accounts -- even when I had free ones, too.  That's because I meet great 
people on commercial ISPs that offer shell accounts, both staff and fellow 
customers.  So if you still want to learn how to be a Unix wizard, if you want 
to learn how to have a chance of becoming a Hacker Wargame winner, and if this 
is important enough to you to pay the people who are working so hard to make 
this happen, please email for details.

 *** What Is a Real Hacker? 
_______________________________________________________________________

So many people nowadays think a hacker is *only* someone who breaks into 
computers.  No way!  Some people break into computers simply because they found 
a poorly defended computer and a program they could run to break in.  That 
isn't even hacking -- it's just running software.  Big "effing" deal. 
Following is a story about a REAL hacker.

From: "Prescott Ken" <prescott_ken@bah.com> 
Subject: Death of a Hacker

Carolyn,

I first heard of you on rec.aviation.military NG back in 1994-1995.  IIRC, you 
were interested in boost-glide vehicles.  I didn't know anything about beyond 
what I read in Sweetman's Aurora book, so I kept my mouth shut.

Since then, I found the Happy Hacker book, and I've enjoyed it...it's a good 
intro to computer security issues.  I took your RTFM advice to heart...right 
now, my bathroom reading is the Windows NT Server Networking Guide...some light 
reading for an MCSE candidate.

I'm hoping you might be able to use the following in your newsletter.  It's not 
directly about hacking, but it's about a man who truly rated the term hacker. 
He passed away on May 20th, and he was my father...

 Death of a Hacker

On May 20th, a true hacker died.

You probably didn't hear of him.  He wasn't the sort to blow his horn before 
himself in public.

He was my father, and he helped bring about today's world...

In the late 1950s, the Navy faced a big problem.  Combat's speed had passed 
beyond the ability of manual tracking procedures to keep pace.  Computers were 
the answer...but there were so many questions.

Imagine taking a machine that was, at the time, a metaphor for unreliable 
performance in even the most tightly controlled environment.

Now, take that computer, and place it on a platform that pitches, rolls, and 
yaws unpredictably--one that sails the ocean (usually the Norwegian Sea, the 
North Atlantic, typhoon-infested portions of the Pacific, and areas where the 
"cooling" water comes in at almost 100 degrees Fahrenheit).

Further, take away that nice, perfectly arranged power setup.   Replace it with 
one that's temperamental, mounted on that same free-moving platform, and 
already strained by supplying power to radar, electrical lighting for a large 
building, and the many other functions that are essential aboard a fighting 
ship of the U.S. Navy.

You can't stop there! Now, you have to have a reasonable secure means of 
networking it to other computers on other ships...

...oh, by the way, this network has to be wireless in an era that thought color 
TV was pushing the limits of RF technology.

Now, let's add in another element...

The enemy.

This system can expect efforts to exploit its datalink signals to detect and 
track the ships; it can expect to come under very heavy jamming during an 
actual attack, and it will have to keep functioning even after the ship's been 
torpedoed or bombed. (Think shock damage). If it fails, men will die and ships 
will sink; conceivably, a war could be lost.  In an era where cryptographic and 
information processing technology was appallingly primitive by today's 
standards, it had to race ahead of developments in weapons technology--and work 
like heck to stay ahead.

And these requirements had to be met at a time when Viet Nam was going through 
$80 million A DAY, and anything that wasn't geared to fighting Mr. Charles in 
the rice paddies was (a very distant) second priority.

This system was eventually built, and it was called the Naval Tactical Data 
System.  My father got in on the ground floor, and was part of getting it to 
work, as well as the first deployment at sea, and keeping it up to date on a 
budget that never seemed to be quite enough.

NTDS kept a lot of American aircrews from spending a long captivity in a 
stinking cell, or taking a long swim in the Gulf (whichever Gulf that might 
be--Tonkin or Persian). Verily, his wonder widget even brought ME home from a 
scary night over Khadaffi's Line of Death (it's truly amazing how brave fighter 
jocks get when they're bouncing a lone helicopter--and how circumspect they get 
when bounced in turn by a four-pack of F/A-18s).

In the end, he helped the good guys win.

He was a naval officer, and continued a hacking tradition that goes back to 
Benjamin Isherwood (designer of the incomparable Wampanoag, fastest vessel of 
its day), Albert A. Michelson (the first man to measure the speed of light), 
David Taylor (whose towing tank helped put ship hull design onto a scientific 
footing), and "Amazing Grace," the late Rear Admiral Grace Hopper (designer of 
the COBOL programming language, and inventor of the term "computer bug").

So, let's hoist a glass to Dad's memory, and remember that the difference 
between difficult and impossible is that the latter just takes a little 
longer...
