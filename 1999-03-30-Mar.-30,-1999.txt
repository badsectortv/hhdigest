Melissa virus news: http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/special/melissavirus.html

You've probably heard of the Melissa virus by now.  First detected March 26, 
it has crashed quite a few mail servers across the Internet through its 
trick of using a macro embedded in an MS Word document to make MS Outlook 
email copies of itself under your name to the first 50 people in each 
address list you keep in Outlook.

Early victims of the onslaught have included Microsoft, Intel, parts of the 
US Air Force and some military contractors.  Does this suggest a 
"hacktivist" pattern in which the first copies of the virus were released 
into organizations the coder wanted to crash?

The virus is embedded in a long list of X-rated Web sites along with 
supposedly valid user names and passwords.  It also has been reported to be 
embedded in other documents.  Many Melissa mutations and copycats are also 
running loose.

This virus and its mutants are almost harmless to your own computer -- if 
you don't mind copies of other documents you write and attach to email 
being, in some cases, copied to other people.  The majority of its damage is 
done against the email systems of the Internet.  

Don't want to be part of the Melissa mess?

1) Don't use Windows or any MS Office 97 or 2000 products.

2) OK, you're a sucker and use Microsoft stuff.  Your next recourse is to 
never open an attached file with an MS Office application.  I (Carolyn) use 
Wordpad, which won't run macros.

3) You may already be infected.  Find out whether you are with this free 
online scan at http://www.mcaffee.com. Want to get rid of Melissa?  Help is 
at http://www.zdnet.com/swlib/hotfiles/virus399.html.

Are you a sysadmin?  Are you just an ordinary user but want to help your ISP 
avert crashes of its mail system?  If you have a shell account, you may be 
able to keep a watch on this problem and alert tech support when things get 
into trouble.  Try these commands:

~ > df /var/spool/mail 
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on 
mack.fubar.com:/var/mail 
                     2053515 1884995   161675     92%   /var/spool/mail

~ > df /var/spool/mqueue 
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on 
/dev/sd0f             294439  108908   156088     41%   /var

If you see disk usage going close to 100% on either of these -- call tech 
support!   If you are tech support, you may want to write a script that will 
grep mqueue and mail for the code from the virus.  Here's a sample segment 
of the virus code: 

BreakOffASlice.Subject = "Important Message From " & 
              Application.UserName 
         BreakUmOffASlice.Body = 
            "Here is that document you asked for ... don't show anyone else ;-)"

* Koan.happyhacker.org changes hands yet again!  The new owners have 
announced on koan's web site http://koan.happyhacker.org:

Added By: grue & whenback 
04:58:48 March 27, 1999

The owners of the Koan supervisor apartment have been evicted. 
It was quite a civilized eviction, but the matter is probably not 
settled once and for all. The previous tenants 'tg0d' might very well 
decide to move in again. Only time will tell. Your new landlords 
wish you a continued pleasant stay. :)

Koan.happyhacker.org is a FreeBSD box with a guest account with a really 
stupid password -- even a stupid person can guess it!  When you break in, 
try these commands for lots of fun:

netstat -a 
netstat -r 
ps -auxw 
w 
who

You can even hack the guest web site!

*  Tg0d rules otter.happyhacker.org!  For a good time, check out 
http://otter.happyhacker.org. Otter is a 486 running Slackware Linux 2.3.5 
with a 2.0.34 kernel.  Their web site has an invitation for all of us:

We now are running an IRC server on otter. That is otter.happyhacker.org:6667. 
Come here to discuss hacking in general and to meet all of your buddies.

This IRC server has attracted a superstar --  John Vranesevich of 
http://www.antionline.com.  You can also meet the Wargame administrators on 
Otter IRC, for example Corey Gallatin, who runs the wargame routers; Diode, 
who built meyer.happyhacker.org and is the Happy Hacker Webmaster; and me.

*  Want to learn how to break into wargame computers?  In addition to tg0d's 
server on otter, you may use the Undernet server, channel #koan.  This is 
usually a polite and helpful channel, thanks to the many volunteers who op 
it.  Don't know how to use IRC?  See the GTMHH on IRC at 
http://www.happyhacker.org.

*  Technical tip:  Having trouble ftping code into the wargame?  To get past 
our firewall, when you first make your ftp connection, give the "passive" 
command.

* Sorry, folks, but I (Carolyn Meinel) decided to nuke 
fishbone.happyhacker.org.  It was an OpenBSD box.  For a long time it had 
some secret tenants (or at least they *thought* they were secret).  They had 
installed a rootkit that appeared to be almost perfect.  Only flaw I could 
see was that /tmp looked strangely empty.  However, they couldn't hack the 
Cisco router, which dutifully kept records of the comings and goings from 
fishbone, revealing activities that were hidden from the process table, 
netstat, wtmp etc.  

I would have been happy to let the "secret" visitors remain, except that 
they consistently attempted to use fishbone as a platform to commit computer 
crime. While we like to think that we are good enough to block all attempts 
by the baddies to use our wargame as a platform to commit crime, no one is 
perfect.  So I finally decided to terminate them.

So... since the *only* reliable way to boot nasty guests off a computer is 
to reinstall the operating system and other programs from trusted sources, I 
decided to reincarnate fishbone as a NT box.  Right now it's being used and 
tested elsewhere, but expect to see my attempt to run a hardened NT box on 
the wargame soon.

* Meyer.happyhacker.org also has a secret root d00d.  We would appreciate it 
if people who root wargame boxes would please put up web sites to advertise 
their existence.  As long as you try to remain secret, you run the risk that 
if we see what looks like attempts to commit crime coming out of your box, 
we just might replace the operating system and take root back from you. 
However, if we know how to contact you, preferably by phone, if we see nasty 
stuff being attempted from your box, we will contact you when the baddies 
are being busy bees.  This gives you a better chance of getting rid of them 
yourself.  Also, we are happy to help you out by rebooting any wargame 
computer you may control.  (Hint: try "kill (pid) HUP" first.)  We have an 
800 number you may call for wargame tech support.  Sorry, you have to prove 
you are root before you get the 800 number:):)

* dmz.happyhacker.org is a router.  You don't need a user name to get in -- 
just guess the password.  Hint: the password is fined up beyond all 
recognition.  The fellow who owns it is Corey Gallatin.

* Want step-by-step instruction with screen shots for the basics of how to 
break into computers?  Buy the Happy Hacker book 2nd edition, now in its 
second printing. It is 400 pages (up from 260 in the first edition), a large 
format paperback book. You can read about it at the Happy Hacker bookstore, 
http://www.happyhacker.org/bookstore.html. You can order "The Happy Hacker" 
book, second edition (paperback, 400 pages) from anywhere in the world at 
the American Eagle bookstore at http://www.logoplex.com/resources/ameagle 
(or phone toll-free in the US 800-719-4957); or you can get an autographed 
copy shipped to anywhere in the world  by sending a check or money order, 
made out to "Happy Hacker" to PO Box 1520, Cedar Crest NM 87008.  Its price, 
including shipment by Priority or Airmail delivery, is: 
US: $39.95; Canada, Mexico, Ireland, Great Britain, Western Europe: US$46.90 
Everywhere else: US$48.90 
If you live outside the US, just ask your bank to make out a money order for 
US$.

 ***  Mac Users -- You Can Have it Both Ways -- Free! 
_______________________________________________________________________

Do you want to be able to go online with the security of Mac OS, but be able 
to shift to the power of Linux when you're ready to hack?  If you have a 
Power PC Mac, you can have some serious fun.  At http://www.linuxppc.com you 
can find out how to get LinuxPPC Live. This is a free demonstration version 
of LinuxPPC which you can run from your Mac OS hard disk without having to 
partition it.

 *** Help for AOL Users 
_______________________________________________________________________

If you use America Online (AOL), it is possible that nothing in this chapter 
will work for you.  This is because AOL is not an Internet Service Provider, 
but an online service which lets you use some carefully selected parts of 
the Internet.  Some versions of the AOL software won't let you use many 
hacking tools, for example telnet, ftp, or ping.  

Here are some ways you can solve your problem.

1) Get a real Internet Service Provider (ISP), preferably one that will give 
you a Unix shell account.  You can locate ISPs (including the many that 
offer shell accounts) anywhere in the world at http://celestin.com/pocia.

2) If you live in the US, Netzero.com will give you a free dialup account 
with true Internet connectivity.  Warning: I discovered that every time I 
dial in, Netzero resets the advanced preferences on your Web browser to 
enable Java and Javascript.  Because there are so many ways to use Java and 
Javascript to crash or steal information from you computer, you need to turn 
them off before going to suspicious Web sites.

3)  Can you find an old AOL installation floppy disk?  If you install from 
one of those, when you log on to AOL you should get an online connection 
that will allow you to use all the hacker tools of this chapter.  However, 
the CD-ROM AOL installation disk will NOT let you hack.

 ***  So you Want to Become a Computer Security Professional? 
_______________________________________________________________________

If you get on hacker mailing lists,  or hang out on IRC, you see people 
claiming that you can learn lots about computer security by attending 
conventions such as Rootfest or Def Con.  Er, maybe, but I get the 
impression most security professionals go there to see what computer 
criminals look and act like.  Those cons are great for law enforcement 
professionals who want to get positive identities the people they are trying 
to arrest.

OK, it is true that the tattoos and fangs set, the Goth fashion plate types 
who dominate the hacker cons do get jobs in computer security.  But they 
only can do so if they are superstars.  Who knows whether these d00dz will 
still be able to hold on to their jobs 5 or 10 years from now?  But if you 
want good jobs now that will turn into a solid profession -- learn computer 
security at the conferences where the elite meet.  Here are some I recommend: 
  
SANS99 The Eight National Conference on Systems Administration, Networking 
and Security  
May 7 - 14, 1999   The Hyatt Regency Inner Harbor and  
Baltimore Convention Center, Baltimore, MD 
http://www.sans.org/sans99/index.htm

Usenix: 1st Workshop on Intrusion 
                    Detection and Network

Keydet89 reports that many people are asking him how to change the startup 
and shutdown screens for Win98.  Duh!  Here's what works for me.  Just 
follow exactly the same instructions as for Win 95.  No c:\logo.sys?  Create 
one anyhow.  Enough said.
