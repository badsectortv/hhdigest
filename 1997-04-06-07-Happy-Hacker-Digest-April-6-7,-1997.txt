 *** IRC Wars Lead to DOS Attacks on Infowar Server 
=================================================================

TO:     Happy Hackers 
FROM  Infowar.Com 
RE:      DOS Attacks

On Friday, April 5, and Saturday April 6, infowar.com, and thereby tens of 
thousands of users, suffered 3 DOS (denial od service) attacks on our IRC. 
This attack took out the router, bringing the entire network down, several 
unrelated domains that sat on the same server, and numerous innocent folks 
having dial-up accounts.

Guess what? We are royally disturbed! (Polite version.) We put up the IRC 
Server in part to requests from the hacker/programming community who want to 
share in the legitimate infosec dialog with professionals; not to act like 
uncouth stepchildren of a screeching Banshee.  This server was put up as a 
tool of enjoyment and education for all participants and lurkers, not as a 
battleground for war.  The vast majority of the users on out IRC server are 
responsible and follow the guidelines of common decency. But, there are 
always one or two who think it is real cute to mess with other people's lives.

Wrongo Moose breath(s)!

Many security professionals have been critical of the interaction between 
hackers and the professional community and it is malicious behavior like 
this that proves them right. Many of us choose to disagree on many issues, 
and that is much of what the infosec field is about: growth, evolution and 
refinement.  But - and hear this clearly - personal or professional 
differences or "boredom" do not constitute permission to act like total 
fools! If you're bored, get a life.

DOS attacks against our server WILL NOT be tolerated. The IRC server will be 
down for several days while we enhance security, build in more restrictions 
and determine if it's even worth it. When the server is brought back up, if 
similar DOS attacks occur, we may well choose to close the server down and 
open for our events only. The choice is yours.

Police your own community. If you have any information regarding these 
attacks, we urge you to speak to your friends and acquaintances.   As a 
responsible user, and in keeping with wanting the Internet to be a better 
place, you should consider that you are ethically bound to bring forward any 
and all information relevant to those who launch DOS attacks against a 
server.  All information shall remain CONFIDENTIAL

The Hacker and Programming Community NEEDS to address these acts with their 
own. DOS attacks are just plain and simple INEXCUSABLE and LAME . You're 
making it hard on the users who stay within the guidelines of responsible 
use of the Internet and IRC.

We have also received many negative comments about our rule "No Profanity". 
Many of you are accustomed servers that have very loose rules.  Our "No 
Profanity" rule stands.  Think of our server as "PG-13".  If you don't like 
that, by all means, we invite you to go somewhere else.

It is not our intention to be mean or hard.  It is our intention to keep 
within the mission of our IRC server, and that is to promote education and 
awareness in the infosec community. Volunteers run this server, and they do 
not need the grief. (You should hear what they want me to do! Some were 
creatively painful, others constituted cruel and unusual punishment. I am 
going to bide my time, though, and hopefully let the H/P community deal with 
this in your own, eminently effective manner. We made this place for you. 
Help us keep it open - for you.

Regretfully,

Carolyn: Some hackers say that if an Internet host such as the Infowar 
server is vulnerable to attack, it is the fault of the sysadmins of that 
server for allowing these vulnerabilities. However, the measures needed to 
make the Infowar server invulnerable to attack would also prevent  the 
public -- you people -- from using it. Do you want Infowar restricted to 
just a select few who would get one-time passwords? Do you want the IRC 
server shut down? These will increase security. But if we want it open to 
all, we have to make those who abuse the privilege feel like they *NEVER* 
want to try those lame stunts again.

If you would like to review the logs of the IRC sessions in which certain 
individuals made threats of DOS which were followed within minutes by 
successful attacks, email me.

From: "Kevin Macey" <imagekiwi@hotmail.com>

>From Imagekiwi, 
      Firstly, I was Looking through a new Zealand mag that my mom bought back 
from N.Z for me. And It told me of a great spam-stopper Program, called... 
"Spam Hater", that tells you the person's name, and ISP name.. Found at

 *** Hacking Port 110 
==================================================

From: arachnophile@emarkt.com

>I was wondering if you know the correct commands to enter once you 
>connect to the incoming mail port? anything that I type says error!!!! 
>Also is there a way to get my mail from the server through a certain 
>port, if so what are the commands? Thanks!

Since you said incoming mail, I assume you mean port 110.

The commands are:

USER <username> (first part of the e-mail address) 
PASS <password> (you'll need to find this out or guess) 
RETR <message> (each message is numbered, usually from 1 but may be 0) 
DELE <message> (if you can't work this one out, unsubscribe!) 
QUIT

You can telnet to your own ISP's mail server on port 110 and login using 
your username and password and retrieve your own mail, if you really enjoy 
doing that type of thing.

>From: "Stephen James" <SJAMESFLORIDA-WELLINGTON@WORLDNET.ATT.NET> 
>Linux refuses to recognize my internal modem.

Linux does something no other OS I have ever worked with does.  The 
configuration files for things like modems and video often require proper 
ASCII order.  If you have the driver listed in the file out of sequence, 
Linux can't find it.  Just a thought, but give it a try.

From: BJ Johnson <bjjohnson@mail.usinternet.com>

I'm thinking of installing Linux but my hard-drive is too small to put 
that on and leave Win 95 on.  I still want to have Win 95 as my main OS 
since I'm not the only user of the computer.  I was wondering if anyone 
knew how to install it (preferably RedHat 4.1) onto a ZipDisk. 
Hopefully then I would be able to use a bootdisk to switch over to Linux 
when I boot up.  I've read most of the How-To's at sunsite.com but 
haven't found any relevant information.

One idea I had was if it would be possible to use UMSDOS and just make 
it think that the ZipDisk is another partition on my hard-drive.  (If it 
makes any difference, it's the parallel-port version.)

Also, what programs/files would I need if I just want Internet 
software?  Thanks!

Jeez, haven't any of you guys ever heard that the closest distance between 
two points is a straight line?  Think about it.  Netscape has a mail program 
installed.  It needs your Email address and account in order for you to use 
that program.  So you think whenever you switch accounts your gonna haveta 
edit the registry in order to change your Email address???  Go OPTIONS, go 
to Mail and News preferences, go to Identity, and change your info to 
whatever the hell you want!  I mean, do you think Netscape would really 
design a product that would require you to edit the registry in order to 
change your info?  We're not talking about Micr0$oft here.  Well, hope I 
haven't offended ya, considering I'm more than twenty years your junior. See 
ya!  And happy hacking.

Sounds like an mIRC trick. The mIRC client supports coloured text. So 
in File | Setup | Localinfo , you can input your Localhost in the 
following format: Type [Ctrl]+k 0  then your user@host.domain address 
followed by [Ctrl}+k 0 again. This has the effect of making your 
user@host appear in white text, which, on mIRC's white background, 
looks invisible :) So instead showing:

***R337_D00d (Lamer@some.loser.com) has joined #IRCHelp

What you appears on screen is something along the lines of:

***R337_D00d (~

Tip #1 : Most IRC servers won't allow you on with control codes in your 
address....at most you should expect to be let on without ident. 
Tip #2 : You will only be invisible to mIRC users who don't read tip #3. 
Tip #3 : Get round this problem by setting in: Tools | Remote | Events :

1:ON JOIN:#:if $chr(3) isin $fulladdress { echo 12 -a $nick at 
$strip($address) has joined $chan } 
1:ON PART:#:if $chr(3) isin $fulladdress { echo 12 -a $nick at 
$strip($address) has left $chan }

This looks for a control code in the address and echoes a message to the 
screen:

R337_D00d at Lamer@some.loser.com has joined #IRCHelp

Hope that helps :)

============================================================ 
 *** Cracking Questions 
============================================================

        Please make this anonymous. 
        When you make a phf query, what do the different parts of the 
response mean. For example, when you try to get the password file 
(/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd), you get this line at the 
top: 
        /usr/local/bin/ph -m alias=x /bin/cat /etc/passwd

 What does this mean? On some systems with the bug present, the password 
file follows, while on others, it doesn't. On one system I was on, I used 
ls to see the etc directory. Since the password file was shadowed, I tried 
/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/shadow, which I had just proved 
was present. However, all I got was /usr/local/bin/ph -m alias=x /bin/cat 
/etc/shadow and nothing after. Why is this? Is it hidden or something? 
        I know that only some UNIX commands work like this. Does rm work 
(I'm curious; I would have just tried if I wanted to delete something)? 
What kind of commands don't work? By the way, does anybody know of any 
good web sites/text files on this kind of thing that they could post? 
Thanks.

From: "NiNo FuNk-MaStA" <nino@main.rgv.net>

I hear much talk of surfing ports but what good will that do a clue-less 
person.  I mean, I could surf ports till I was blue in the face and still 
not have accomplished much other than knowing that <insert your favorite 
port here> was open.  What is there to do as far as being out side trying 
to get IN?  Are there exploits, techniques...?  As far as being inside, my 
ISP has it's shadow file locked in a root read-only attrib mode. Aren't 
there other ways....it seems every exploit I try is futile. Each day, I 
scour the net for new ones. (I have plenty of time, I am a "Lab Consultant" 
<in house computer-geek who fixes/upgrades/installs hard/software...>) I 
would like to get root some day...=)  I have been at it for 1.5 month(s) 
and well......Any suggestions?

Me again, I scanned some ports with a win 95 port scanner and found the 
following.

202.154.1.3 port 21 
202.154.1.3 port 23 
202.154.1.3 port 25 
202.154.1.5 port 13 
202.154.1.5 port 9 
202.154.1.5 port 21 
202.154.1.5 port 25 
202.154.1.5 port 23 
202.154.1.5 port 19 
202.154.1.6 port 7 
202.154.1.6 port 9 
202.154.1.6 port 13 
202.154.1.6 port 19 
202.154.1.6 port 23 
202.154.1.6 port 21 
202.154.1.6 port 25 
202.154.3.2 port 21 
202.154.3.2 port 19 
202.154.3.2 port 23 
202.154.3.2 port 25 
202.154.3.2 port 13

now what do I do.  Can I get into any of these computers, how?  ( I'm a 
newbie remember)

Is Perl Availible for win 95 yet? if so where can i get it, and if not 
where can I get the NT version of it.

Imagekiwi

Carolyn: Perl has been ported to Win NT, but I'm not sure if it will rin on 
Win 95.

Now, since I'm the Supreme Moderator, I get to rant awhile before telling 
you more technical stuff. If you break into these computers and you don't 
have permission from their owners, you are breaking the law. But it is good 
practice for learning security to play break-in games with computers that 
you do have permission to hack.

If you have permission, the next thing you do is find out what services are 
running on each port. For example, on 25 you might find sendmail, smail or 
qmail. There are automated programs such as Satan that will tell you what 
services are on each port. But -- if you run Satan from a shell account your 
ISP will probably catch you and cancel your account! It is best to run these 
programs from some sort of Unix on your home computer. Sorry, there aren't 
any good ones I know of for Windows.

Once you have figured out the services, the next step is to find out whether 
there are any exploits known for them. Lots of exploit code is floating 
around on Web sites and lists such as this one. Or, if you happen to be a 
genius, you can create your own exploits.

Next step is to get the code for your exploit to run on your computer. Most 
exploits are written to run under the Unix operating system. But there are a 
zillion slightly -- and greatly -- different brands of Unix. There are also 
many Unix shells, most notably bash (Bourne Again Shell), ksh (Korn shell) 
and tcsh(tektronic C shell). You may have to make some alterations in an 
exploit before it runs on your computer. Also, that kewl exploit you 
download from Deadly Evil Haxors of the Global Poohbahs may contain 
malicious code that makes a big mess of your computer.

Now if you get the exploit to run, the next thing is to figure out how to 
tiptoe around your or your friend's computer in such a way as to not make a 
mess. When you are the root user in Unix or in the  Administrative account 
of a Windows NT system it is easy to accidentally make a mess. That's why 
people are being so slow to offer computers for anyone on this list to try 
to hack.

Thank you to all you guys (and I won't tell  you who they are because we 
don't want strangers playing hacking games) who have given me permission to 
hack your computers! Several people have promised to open up some computers 
for anyone to hack soon. I'll let everyone on this list know s soon as they 
are ready.

===========================================================

Reply-To: Duncan Mak <vulcan@asiaonline.net>

hi, 
Question 1, 
My ISP, asiaonline has 3 dial in phone numbers. One of them are 
extensively used for PPP connections, it provides automatically switch to 
PPP. The other 2, can also do PPP but it does not do automatically switch 
to PPP. I dialed into that number yesterday, and found out it does 
traceroute and a whole lot more. The help file is forwarded to you. 
Do any of you know what these stuff do? A lot of the commands are disables 
or 'you do not have enough security privilege to do so'.

Question2, 
when I use uname, it says SunOS, but when I telnet to localhost, it is 
SystemV. What is this?

Carolyn: Congratulations, you have a shell account. But I am puzzled by why 
telnet localhost (same as telnet 127.0.0.1) gives you a different operating 
system. Anyone have ideas?

<< From: Twigz Wiggy <twiggy@hq.tcfarm.com> 
  
 The sysop at my ISP says I have a shell account and he told me I just 
 have to telnet into the server and that's it. but when I telnet, a 
 window comes up with some options (Pine, Tin, an FTP thing, etc.)  But 
 I can't find anything about how I can type in things like 'telnet-> 
 boring.isp.net 80' ... 
  
 bench: twigs, by the looks of it, you have a telnet account running a 
 menu program. look for an option that says Exit to Shell or something. 
 or go ask your sysop! 
  >>

On my shell account I get about the same thing...there are individual menu 
selections for things like telnet and ftp.  If you want to run from a prompt 
so you can use things like whois etc... on mine I can just press ^Z  (ctrl + 
Z)  This drops me at a prompt where I can just enter commands.  If I do 
things like telnet from the menu I have to do something like this: 
   Enter a selection: 2 
  
   Telnet>open server.com  ##

At the shell prompt I can just type: 
   telnet server.com ##  instead. 
  
   Hope this helps.

From: "Xenakis" <xenakis@epix.net>

(In answer to same shell account question)

Some syops put it under a key combo such as SHIFT + 1 (!). Then a message 
displays such as "Spawning your default shell". If you get that, you should 
see a prompt such as "peach[1]% ". If that doesn't work, you could use an 
option that they sometimes put telnet under "Login to Remote Systems", or 
something of that effect. Once you get to the a prompt of any kind, its 
time to buy a few UNIX/Linux books (depending on your needs), then go from 
there! Note: better save up for these books - a lot of the good ones that 
can run up to $60. Personally, I recommend O'Reilly, as most people on this 
list would as well..... 
Please keep in mind that I am a newbie as well, so correct if I am wrong on

 *** Computer Security Awareness Conference 
====================================================

Regal Harvest House Hotel 
Boulder, Colo.

May 15th and 16th 1997

IGN Inc. of Boulder, Colorado would like announce CSAC 97'. This two day 
conference will 
inform and educate business owners, managers and office professionals, by 
introducing and 
explaining a wide variety electronic security issues facing most businesses 
today. We feel our conference will be of benefit to any business which uses 
the internet, telephones, computers, networks, cellular phones, PBX or other 
electronic devices or systems to store, transmit or receive sensitive or 
confidential matter.

With the recent popularity of the Internet and world wide web anyone with 
computer access to the Internet can download hundreds of different espionage 
related software programs and thousands of pages of text describing in 
detail how to gain access to almost any type of electronic system or 
computer network.

As a result electronic crimes are being committed by a wider variety of 
people. Anyone with a basic understanding of computers and electronics can 
learn to defeat security and passwords on almost type of computer, gain 
access to and monitor your telephone and modem, generate valid credit card 
numbers from specific banks, monitor your access to the Internet, access 
your private files or credit report and in general learn anything they want 
to about you all by following simple instructions or using underground 
software available on hundreds of sites on the Internet.

Today any employee or outsider can quickly learn to defeat passwords, PIN 
and access codes, access e-mail accounts, generate company credit cards, use
