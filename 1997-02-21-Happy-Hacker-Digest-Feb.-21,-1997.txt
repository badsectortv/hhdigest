CANADIAN HACKING LAWS

From: "Ty & Keri - Lynn Smith" <8beaner@iaw.on.ca>

Greetings all.

I found you latest threads about the laws regarding computer crime and 
hacking of interest, but also noted that they were for the American people 
and not of those from other parts of the world. Living here in Canada I was 
curious as to how much different our laws were on this subject. So out I 
went and purchased myself a copy of the 1997 revision of the Canadian 
Pocket Criminal Code.

Here goes the code for computers in Canada:

-------

Unauthorized Use of Computers-Definitions-"Computer program"-"Computer 
service"-"Computer system"-"Data"-Electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or 
other device"-"Function"-Intercept".

Section 342.1 (1) Every one who, fraudulently and without color of right,

 (a) obtains, directly or indirectly, any computer service, 
 (b) by means of an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device, 
intercepts or causes to be intercepted, directly or indirectly, any 
function of a computer system, or 
 (c) uses or causes to be used, directly or indirectly, a computer system 
with intent to commit an offence under paragraph (a) or (b) or an offence 
under section 430 in relation to data or a computer system

is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term 
not exceeding ten years, or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary 
conviction.

(2) In this section,

"computer program" means data representing instructions or statements that, 
when executed in a computer system, causes the computer system to perform a 
function;

"computer service" includes data processing and the storage or retrieval of 
data;

"computer system" means a device that, or a group of interconnected or 
related devices one or more of which, 
 (a) contains computer programs or other data, and 
 (b) pursuant to computer programs, 
  (i) performs logic and control, and 
  (ii) may perform any other function;

"data" means representations of information or of concepts that are being 
prepared in a form suitable for use in a computer system;

"electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device" means any device 
or apparatus that is used or is capable of being used to intercept any 
function of a computer system, but does not include a hearing aid used to 
correct subnormal hearing of the user to not better than normal hearing;

"function" includes logic, control, arithmetic, deletion, storage and 
retrieval and communication or telecommunication to, from or within a 
computer system;

"intercept" includes listen to or records a function of a computer system, 
or acquire the substance, meaning or purport thereof.

R.S. 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 45

Well if you can get through that gobblygook great. It took me a couple of 
readings, but I don't think that the law makers intended the laws to be 
legible to us mere mortals. Sortta like Unix or C. A secret language given 
to only the deserving and ->patient<-.

VIGILANTE IDEAS

From: "Ryan" <c.barrett@virgin.net>

Regarding the Child Porn sites:

If I found a Child Porn site, I would (theoretically) have no qualms about 
shutting it down, or even mail bombing the owner.  I can see them going to 
the police and saying:  "Hey, this guy just trashed my website full of 
pictures of pre-pubescent children!  I've still got the original pictures, 
but the 2,000 visitors a week I get are being denied their fun".  I can see 
the polices reply; "Hum, can you show us these pictures?  (After showing 
them to the police)  your coming with us down to the station on charges of 
possession of indecent pictures of underage children.".  The point is, if 
they dob you in, then they will get into real trouble, far more than you 
could- so they won't.  They'll probably just mail-bomb you back again! 
  There is a better way to get these sites down though.  There has just 
been formed an organization that you can report obscene and possibly 
illegal websites to, for prosecution/removal.  I believe they have a free 
phone number, and they have a mail address.

I have and idea of how to stop mail bombs.  sendmail could be modified so 
that it scans all messages for signs of Mail-Bomb script.  If it does find 
it, then it sends it to the sender, not the receiver.  That would put an 
immediate end to all of the problems, and teach the stupid kids not to use 
mail bomb programs!

You have to figure out _where_ Setup is looking for the file and place the 
.DLL in that directory. Here's a complete guess, but it might help: 
1) Open a DOS window. Start Menu/Run... and type command. Or Start 
Menu/Programs/MS-Dos Prompt. 
2) Type SET. This will show you your environment variables. 
3) Look at the one that says TEMP=. This is _probably_ where the setup 
program is looking for the .DLL. 
Note: If you don't want to/don't know how to do that, 9 times out of 10, 
the TEMP directory is C:\windows\temp. 
4) Copy the .DLL and throw it in that directory.

This _might_ work. I've had some programs do the same thing. Basically, 
move the .DLL around to directories that the Setup program is most likely 
looking in. Maybe one level up? Hope this helps.

In Undernet, they now have the bots X and W. these bots take care of 
a channel, keep a registry of authorized ops, and can do simple tasks 
as flood detection. as long as the server can allow, X and W will 
stay on your channel, protecting it from takeovers. but all this is 
ideal and sometimes, due to lagging, X disappears.

From: <nobody@www09.hway.net>

Concerning IRC: I was operating under the impression that it made absolutely 
no difference what server you logged in to, since all the comm data gets 
routed to everywhere else.  If this is so, then why do so many seasoned IRC 
users put such emphasis on their particular server?  I wonder if it's simply 
because of the quicker response one gets when speaking/DCCing to another 
user sharing the same server as oneself.

 I came across a .gif somewhere that mapped out the physical location of all 
the major IRC servers - it was rather informative.  I wonder if anyone can 
give me a clue as to where I could find a similar map showing the backbone 
of the Internet as well as major service providers, say, the big telcos and 
maybe two or three branches down.

So, the happy hacker digest finally talks about ping -f! GREAT! One 
thing is, this is a great for all the people that have it on IRC and 
have windows 97. I DO have mirc but, I have win3.1 and I never chat or 
look for fights in mIRC. The problem is, I chat on a normal Internet chat 
(yah yah with the refresh and post and all that) From time to time one 
gets the loserz wandering in looking for the cheap thrills in disgusting 
people, showing off their perversion, being nuisances, etc.. How can a 
guy with an OS like mine keep these dopes off, or at least bother them 
enough to keep them off. I've heard of ping -f (I’ve got finger utils , 
tracers, router info utils etc.) And i don’t have a unix account to get 
at these naughty people. Where can i get a ping -f Win3.1 util? Rest 
assured it will be put to good use on those unfortunate enough to 
disgust the heck outta the rest of us.

MORE ON CRACKING

Anonymous: hi my first post to this wondergroup.

after reading many questions about how to hack past a windoze 95 screen 
saver ,and reading many replies, it struck me that perhaps no one knew that 
if you simply press f5 just after the ms-dos text you get a c: prompt.

 next type 
c:\windows 
at the c:\windows type ` edit control.ini`

you are then whooshed away to the edit shell, where as you scroll down the 
screen and when you see the word...

password=1

change the 1 to a 0 and save then reboot!simple. 
and when you’re finished do the same only type a 1 to activate the screen 
saver again. 
 

thanks to Olcay Cirit for that. text file `pc hacking faq` 7/10/96

tip for newbies read as many text files as you can , that’s what i do. And 
you be amazed at what you’ll learn.

On a different note` i work for cgate and wonder if any one could tell me `

if seagate has hundreds of computers and all networked some not as to stop 
people like my self from prying.(they do it by use of a login:) 
I’ve cracked a lot of passwords in seagate and the weakest link is the

if some one tries to access the g drive it says invalid drive specification,

what i want to know is ,is it possible to access some else’s c:drive from

From: Marko Samastur <Marko.Samastur@fmf.uni-lj.si>

To those, that think social engineering is hacking, there are few words 
I'd like to say. I've been watching this conversation around hacking and 
hacking techniques for a while and I've had enough. It seems like there 
are too many people out there, who don't have the slightest clue what 
hacking was and is. It's a wish and a need to further develop your 
knowledge and to seek information. 
So, how the h*** can in that context a scam, involving a stupid guard, 
be even considered as important part of HACKING. Sure it's an important 
part of getting physical access to computer, but it has nothing to do 
with hacking. And you don't get any knowledge from it. Almost the same 
goes for tricks. While they can be fun to play with, they are only that. 
Not much knowledge behind them and should I do it to impress people. 
H*** no, the next thing you will advertise will be wearing ties I guess 
(or even worse, wearing suits, yuck). Actually, it's even repulsive to 
use both words as physical and hacking so close together. ;) 
Not only that, will you people drive around the globe to be able to do 
that, or are your needs limited only to your hometown. My sure aren't 
(before Carolyn complains about saying too much, let me add that hacking 
is ALMOST legal here and if I don't break one or two rules, I can do 
almost anything I want, involving breaking into computers in my or other 
countries). 
Oh and btw, * in passwd file STILL CAN mean that it's shadowed (I'm not 
sure, but I think * should be in front of the name, if you want to 
disable user of that account). Anyway, if those users are just disabled, 
where are the encrypted passwd then? :) 
Please feel free to flame me, but I insist that you allow me to do the 
same.

you're right. There are systems out there that have remote problems. But 
most serious Sysadmins keep up with the cert (and other) advisories. I 
find most systems i try for patch them up REALLY quickly. But i don't 
usually go for college systems. If I do, i simply social engineer one of 
the students in CS101 who just put upa web page.

again, you're right. But i assume that you are an experienced person 
with computers and I would prolly know that through research. I wouldn't 
dare to attempt to engineer you. That would be an exercise in futility. 
As mean as it is to say it, you SE the dumb. SEing most sysops is kinda 
silly. They'll pick it up quickly. I'm not dumb enough to try to SE 
root, just a user pass. Root is found through local exploits.

I don't know jackdookey about Tiger Teams. I'd love to participate with 
one, but never have. I've run into plenty of hackers that put down SE 
attacks as "unchallenging", "silly" and "Not hacking (which it very well 
may not be)". I agree it is essential. That's my whole point. I see that 
you don't overlook it, but obviously people do, or else I’d hardly be 
even fairly successful. I wish there were more hackers (and users) who 
knew the dangers of it. I'm just trying to expose it. Obviously you are 
too. 
I just think it's as good a sploit as any. That's all.

"Tell me what you want, a zigahzigzah." 
-From "The wit and wisdom of the Spice Girls" 
 

From: PsyChadEl <oberoi@hal-pc.org>

A lot of the hacking/cracking techniques/methods etc... discussed on Happy 
Hacker seem to be completely network orientated (not that that's a bad 
thing). However, there's a whole world of hacking/cracking out there that 
NEEDS to be explored.

Apart from the Social Engineering aspect that Bernz spoke of in the previous 
digest, there's also the kind of access that users have: directly to PCs in 
their offices, students in their libraries, blah blah blah. This is where 
the keystroke recorder comes in (tada).

The keystroke recorder (for those of U who don't know), is basically a 
program that sits in memory and logs every key typed at particular computer. 
That means: letters, memos, credit card numbers, passwords, poetry, 
garbage... U get the idea. Therefore, U setup the recorder, leave it on for 
a couple of days... come back and have a look - and voila! We're in luck.

Now, the problem I'm writing in is this: I'm interested in a good keystroke 
recorder for a Windows OS (meaning Win95 or Win3.11 or both). I found one on 
the net, something called Keylogger... You'll find it at Silicon's site (me 
thinks). However, it has the pathetic tendency to sit their, totally visible 
as a window on your taskbar (in Win95). It also logs to many filez instead 
of just one - which is a pain in the ass when U go looking thru 'em (that 
problem, however I fixed thru some hexing).

I'm interested in writing one and have been trying to do so for while... 
with little luck. If anyone is aware of any APIs or Dlls that may help with 
a program like this... or know of any other keystroke recorders for 
Windows... then PLEAZE tell me. Some form of cloaking KeyLogger would also 
be a good idea. I've tried a proggy called HideIT (available at 
download.com), but then I have the problem of hiding HideIt itself - no 
problems solved there.

Think about it.

Like I said to the other guy. Try that with my system. You can't SE me out 
of info. You can try to break into my place, but remember that "make my 
day" law. I will be more than happy to knee-cap you.

To further this point, if it were so bad to give the exploit info out, she 
could easily take the 'full disclosure' method and post the exploit along 
with the fix information. No harm there.

> >I heard somewhere that Macs make up 20% of the servers on the Internet,

Yeah. Apple had an infomercial that claimed just over 80% of the servers 
on the net were Macs. That infomercial is no longer being played. I doubt 
20%.

seem to execute it. I’ve tried the obvious quote site exec ... but it only 
works for ls ; with anything else than ls it will go 
200 - exploit 
200 - (end of exploit)

It's a hoax program, much like APEX. A *.zip file I d'loaded once upon a

Subject: Win95 TCP/IP Tracing

Does anybody know of a program that will show what is being sent over a 
Windows 95 based tcip connection, and store it in a log file?

I know that a packet sniffer will give me most of this information, but I am 
trying to do this over a Win95 Dial up networking connection. Do I have to 
patch the tcp/ip protocol to do this or is there a sniffer that will give 
me this information. 
Any help would be great Thankx!

HACKER ETHICS

From: the Phreaked One <phreakitikki@mercury.theonramp.net> 
Subject: Ethics....

>Moderator: IMHO, trying to discuss ethics without referring to experts in 
>ethics such as Jesus, Gandhi and Martin Luther King is like trying to 
>discuss TCP/IP without referencing RFCs. 
>Carolyn Meinel

 Referring to Ethics without them is easy.  There is no one ethical way. 
As one travels between cultures the ethics will change.  They don't change 
because of different religious views (although that does help a little), 
they change because every society is different and wants to be treated 
differently.

 Ethics also change with time.  As time changes so do peoples experience. 
There is also not one single definition of ethics.  Everyone has there own 
definition.  One person may be OK with going out and killing 45 people, who 
is to say he is wrong.  Maybe someone feels he is not wronging a child by 
molesting him/her.  What make these things wrong though to that person? 
The same thing that makes everything else wrong, common courtesy.

 The Golden Rule says, Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 
Basically if you wouldn't want those 45 people to murder you then don't do 
it yourself.  I the case of the child molester though he may have actually 
wanted adults to molest him as a child (as sick as that may sound), so he 
just needs psychological help.

 The point I am trying to get across is simple, though my jumbled writing 
style may have confused you.  Ethics is not about, oh he's a bad man for 
doing that.  It's why did he do that, what makes him do that.  Take 
hacking, people fear hackers because the media portrays them (I only have 
the mentality, not the skill) as anti-social criminals who break into 
systems and format the hard disk or steal thousands of dollars with credit 
card numbers stolen from TRW.  They aren’t hackers though (personally I call 
any hacker who does malicious actions with his/her talent a cracker), 
hackers have ethics of there own and the people on the outside don't see 
them.  Hackers ethics say look, don't touch.  Hackers don't break into 
systems to do damage, they do so just to do it, or possibly so that they 
can get some sort of information off of a system (not credit reports).

 Again people don't look at motives as much as they see actions.  And we as 
hackers (well some of you, not me) are the most misunderstood of the bunch. 
 We are mentioned on Service Merchandise commercials as liars cheats and 
thieves.   That is just not true, people need to look at us not as hackers 
but as curious.  We more then anyone else should understand having ethics 
misunderstood.  Just remember next time you hack a system and decide to do 
damage that not only is it against the law but also if you were the 
sysadmin of that system (and don't say well I'm not so there), would you 
want to clean up after some "cracker."

BAGHDAD SEES INTERNET AS END OF CIVILIZATION

An editorial in the Iraqi government newspaper Al-Jumhuriya says that the 
Internet -- which is not accessible in Iraq -- is "the end of civilizations, 
cultures, interests, and ethics," and "one of the American means to enter 
every house in the world.  They want to become the only source for 
controlling human beings in the new electronic village."  (AP 17 Feb 97)
