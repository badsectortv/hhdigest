   We aren't getting so many posts lately at our Infowar Hackers site 
   (http://www.infowar.com). But more people will read you if you post 
   there than if you post to this list. We only have a little over 
   2,000 readers on this email list, but Betty O'Hearn, who manages 
   that site, Infowar's Hackers forum gets the lion's share of the 
   traffic of some 50,000 hits per week. And remember, Infowar is an 
   award winning site, with a hot link from the prestigious New York 
   Times web site.

   Besides, we are getting way too many excellent posts. The trouble 
   is that many readers are complaining about getting 25 kb/day from 
   this list. Right now we are badly backlogged, too. Post to Infowar 
   and we'll get your post up within 36 hours, whereas you may wait 
   for 5 or 6 days on this list.

*** IRC Woes 
===============================================================================

From: Warpy <root@null.net>

   I'm noticing a disturbing trend starting to form on Infowar's IRC 
   server.  To start off with it was OK. We were a bunch of 
   newbie-intermediate hackers who actually wanted to learn how to 
   hack. There were no op and/or flame wars, and we all managed to get 
   along pretty well.

   However this is not how it is today. Increasingly, people who have 
   heard of the channel either through friends or HH have been leaping 
   on-line.  Unfortunately their only idea of hacking is IRC-war, 
   which is lame to the extreme. But who can blame them? Their just 
   newbie's like we all were at some stage.

   However I would just like to re-iterate that the #hackers channel 
   on www.infowar.com is for the discussion of hacking in all its 
   forms. And under most people definition, channel take-overs, 
   flooding, and pinging someone down with a war script you didn't 
   design is NOT hacking.

   As well as that you DON'T advertise warez in the channel openly. If 
   you've got a site ask people individually whether they'd like a 
   look rather than flooding the screen with "/me has a warez site at 
   123.456.789.0".

   I'm not trying to be a pain in the a**, although I'm sure that's 
   what it's coming across as to some people. I'm trying to get those 
   people out there to whom mIRC and war-scripts are gods to 
   understand there is more to hacking than that. If you really want 
   to trade warez. Setup a new channel, don't join #hackers to trade 
   it. And to those IRC warriors out there, sure playing with a war 
   script is fun. But there is more to hacking than just that.

   Actually, don't get _Unix for Dummies_ if the above is what you are 
   looking for.  I won't knock the Dummies books because I think some 
   of them can be quite useful for people, especially people who are 
   really computer phobic or brand-spanking new at something, but if 
   you even know how to use the MAN command you are almost certainly 
   beyond this book being of much use to you.  I've never encountered 
   the sort of resource you are describing above.  Most Unix books 
   I've encountered (the real Unix books, not the "for Dummies" type 
   books) are pretty useful and straightforward. 
  
   About all _Unix for Dummies_ says about flags is a really basic 
   definition of them and that just because 1's and l's look a lot 
   alike on your screen, they aren't interchangeable.  That's the 
   learning level you are looking at here.  Again, good for someone 
   that that wouldn't occur to, but not much use to anyone who's 
   beyond that point.  ;)

*** Finding Dynamic IP Addresses 
===============================================================================

From: THE ZOMBIE RITUAL<zombie@thepentagon.com>

   I think I can answer this pretty easily.

   The site that you are referring to are using Java. A good example 
   is Silicon Toads page. You go to his page and right there in front 
   of you is your OS what browser and how many times you've been 
   there.  This doesn't mean he knows this about you. I think of this 
   as a Java mirror. All it does is show you what you already see. 
   Many people think this is just the most amazing thing but it isn't. 
   Anyone can do it and it isn't hacking.

   If you want to see how they do it then go to the page you want to 
   see, go to View at the top of your browser then go to "View 
   Document Source", this will show you the HTML and Java script used 
   to publish this page.  These codes are read by Netscape, or what 
   ever browser you use, to create .html documents containing variable 
   font sizes and colors, etc...

   There is no magic to it. Its an illusion at best.

   As far as your friends IP is concerned you have me a little 
   confused.

   I'll explain IP addressing very shortly. An IP is a set of numbers 
   in groups of four. You are assigned these numbers when you log on. 
   They are always the same except for the last three. These three 
   numbers change every time you log on (I wont go into why). Tracking 
   a person should be left to the ISP. You can usually have this done 
   (only if its necessary) by e-mailing the date time and IP number. 
   The ISP will review their logs to see who it was.

   I hope this helped a little. It wasn't very descriptive, so don't 
   take this as gospel.

   Go to a Tucows mirror and look for "IP posters". Such programs for

   Any web server written in more than five minutes can see that. It's 
   not that much to care about if you're just surfing the web, since 
   it's just an IP address, not an email address. Any web server can 
   sense the IP address, direct line to the net does not add anything 
   but speed and a permanent connection.-

   Andre,

   http://www.mirabella.com has some software called ICQ which may be 
   able to help you. It keeps track of people you specify who are 
   online and connected to their site. (Runs in the background).  You 
   may want to make sure it's compatible with AOL, though.

*** Linux Q&A 
===============================================================================

From: "Robert B. Greer" <robin1@kersur.net>

   Can anyone help me . I partitioned my HD and installed Linux 
   leaving half for a Dos partition to reinstall Win95. The first half 
   I left as a DOS partition. When I reinstalled Win I am afraid it 
   took the whole drive back . There didn't seem to be a place in 
   setup to designate where it should go.  Setup said there was an 
   operating system already there.  Any help would be appreciated.

   I am not sure there is really a point for creating the Linux 
   Partitions with Dos's Fdisk. 
  
   What I did, is on my 850 meg drive, I partitioned it into one 600 
   meg partition, which I of course made as the primary active 
   partition, and that was all I did with Dos's Fdisk.  So basically 
   what I had was an 850 meg drive, of which 600 meg was accessible 
   through Win95. 
  
   I then formatted the drive, and rebooted using the BOOT and ROOT 
   disks I had created.

   I then ran Linux's Fdisk, and since I had 250 meg that was not in 
   any partition on my Hard Disk, I made a Linux Native partition and 
   a Swap Partition partition. 
  
   If I am not mistaken if you try to create the Linux Native and Swap 
   Partition using Dos's Fdisk, you will just have to delete them 
   again.  If you exit at this point, and run Dos's Fdisk, and check 
   the partitions on your Hard Disk, you should find that it says one 
   primary partition, and two non-Dos partitions.  Now you just have 
   to install Linux.

   Are there other ways to find info about dgte@foobar.com?

Moderator:

   I anonymized the domain name and some user info to protect the 
   privacy of jopee. One thing I would suggest is to do "whois 
   foobar.com." This will probably give you the technical contact for 
   Joe Schmoe's ISP. Then if this "Joe Schmoe" has been causing you 
   serious trouble, email the technical contact and describe your 
   problem.

   If the whois command doesn't give you the technical contact, there 
   are other options. See the GTMHH Vol.3 No.2 for a bunch more 
   commands that will tell you more, most significantly nslookup. Or, 
   if you have a Unix shell account, give the command "man nslookup" 
   for details of the commands you can run from this invaluable 
   program.

   10x the amount of holes in them as NeXT

Anonymous:

   My question arises from the fact that in this day in age of Caller 
   ID on every phone or modem that matters, how do crackers get into 
   systems? I mean eventually any dialup no matter how routed can be 
   traced back to a base number somewhere and other than cell clones I 
   can't conceive other untraceable methods. Wouldn't detection be as 
   easy as asking telephone companies to show their logs or something? 
   And isn't cell cloning expensive?  It's been a question I've been 
   asking myself ever since I read The Fugitive Game, shouldn't it be 
   easy to catch crackers by now? On a side note who is GALF? (I'm new 
   to this list.)

Moderator:

   GALF stands for Gray Areas Liberation Front. Gray Areas is a 
   magazine edited and owned by Netta Gilboa. At last year's def con 
   convention there a near-riot broke out when Netta used her speech 
   to accuse a long list of hackers, many of whom were present, of 
   being narcs. GALF then set out to punish her attackers, but got 
   mixed up on who they were. I wasn't even there at the time. Since 
   then the dc-stuff  and Happy hacker email lists have both been 
   prime GALF targets. The modus operandi is to break into a computer, 
   send threatening and obscene messages to email addresses found on 
   the system, and then erase the system files. Breaking tactics 
   typically begin with sniffed passwords, followed by installing a 
   program that allows telnet into a root shell.

   repeat after me: 
   Ident has NOTHING to do with the computer knowing your IP address! 
   ALL Ident does is make a query to port 113 of your computer and if 
   you have Identd installed there it will ask Identd to provide the 
   server with your Username.  The easiest way to get around this is 
   to install an Identd on your computer, and feed it a fake Username 
   (you can use this to fake a fake Email).  If you have Win/Win95, 
   edit the Ident tab in mIRC setup and leave mIRC running when you 
   send your fakemail.   I posted a pretty long description on how to 
   exploit this at Infowar in the "forging Email tips" section.

   I'd ask Rogue Agent and a few other guys how come they saw GALF and
