From: Sweasel18@aol.com

First I would like to congratulate Mysidia on his/her hack.  I'm in #koan 
(on the Undernet IRC server) all the time and have had quit a few people 
come in and ask how Mysidia got root. I guess not everyone is able to 
understand Mysidia's explanation (personally I thought it was pretty good). 
I am going to try to tell you how he did it in more detail.  Since I am not 
Mysidia I might be off on some things so don't 
take this as 100% accurate. 

Satori gave the clue that there was a permissions hole and that the hole 
opened monthly.  The fact that it opens monthly should lead you to the 
crontab file in /etc.  Go there and you notice monthly is run monthly and 
monthly runs a file called monthly.local.  In monthly.local is a command, 
build world and this compiles a lot of files including ping.c.  Now at this 
point you don't know that ping.c is where the hole is.  This is probably 
when Mysidia gave the command nice +20 find /usr/src -type f -perm 
-o+w.somefile &.  I'm not real familiar with this command but I can explain 
some of it.  The find is looking for files in /usr/src that have world write 
permissions.  It saves the results to .somefile and the & makes the command 
run in the background.  Now Mysidia probably opened up .somefile and found 
ping.c in there.  Now he adds some c code of his own to ping.c and then 
waits for crontab to compile it.  Satori noticed someone found the hole and 
modified ping.c so he had it compile early but if Satori hadn't done that 
the crontab would have done it at the end of the month.  Once it compiled 
Mysidia probably just had to execute the ping command and then he obtained 
root.  Mysidia has patched this hole so you CAN NOT use it to get root!

This may not be totally accurate but it should give you a good idea as to 
how Mysidia rooted Koan. For the newbies that don't know Unix or don't 
understand the basics as how to hack.  Visit sites like www.antionline.com 
and view their beginning guides to hacking Unix.  Most of these guides will 
start by telling you the basic Unix commands.

PCHelp needs your help!

The PCHelp site is in very real danger of being REMOVED.

You are one of a great many people who have been helped by me and/or my 
website.  I am writing you because I now need your help in return.  My 
website, the principal page of which is found at 
http://www.nwi.net/~pchelp/bo/bo.html is at serious risk of being 
COMPLETELY TAKEN DOWN.

Why?  It is because I have chosen to expose a fraudulently advertised 
product called Lockdown 2000.  Lockdown 2000 is a software product which 
purports to deal with ALL Trojans (such as Back Orifice) and with ALL 
threats to personal PC security.  The claims made for this product are 
false, and I have exposed the facts in several pages on my site.

I encourage you to read what I have written about Lockdown.  Links are 
prominently displayed at the top right of the main BO page.

The primary perpetrator of the Lockdown scam, Michael Paris, has written 
to my ISP threatening a $100,000+ lawsuit if my site is not shut down.

The full story of that threat is at: 
http://www.nwi.net/~pchelp/bo/LDthreat.htm 
READ THIS STORY NOW because it could be removed forever within a single 
day!

 *** FBI vs. Meinel 
_______________________________________________________________________

From: "J.D. Abolins" <jda-ir@njcc.com>

In your recent Happy Hacker email, you mentioned the problems with the FBI 
because of false accusations. I am not an attorney but I have come across 
many accounts of how interactions of civilians with law enforcement people 
can go astray. 

>I consulted with four lawyers.  They all said the FBI only gives lie 
>detector tests to trick someone into saying something that will get them 
>arrested.  Oct. 30 I told Baldwin I would not take the test.  She got pretty 
>ugly about it, tying to persuade me I'd better take the test if I didn't 
>want to be arrested.

I am sorry to hear about the hassles you are getting from the FBI.  
(Reminds me of the old adage that no good deed goes unpunished.  
<groan>)

I thank you and admire you for the way you handle the procedures the  
Bureau was using. Consulting your attorney and refusing the polygraph  
was the right thing to do. The more people give in to the pressure, the 
more entrenched the pressure techniques become.

For what it's worth, I'll state something you probably know already, it is 
both legal and a common practice for law enforcement officers (LEOs) to use 
their own form of social engineering. (Interestingly enough, in my neck of 
the woods in NJ, a city's police department is adamant about not having 
videotaping of interrogations...eh...interviews and confessions. Seems that 
beneath the objections is the fear that jurors, seeing some of the 
techniques, might tend to acquit.) 

   "Although it is unlikely that we shall ever again experience the sort of 
routine third-degree brutality in police stations that was commonplace in 
the 1920s and 1930s, deceptive techniques, even more advanced than those 
decried by the _Miranda_ majority, have become the hallmark of the police 
interrogation trade. Among the most effective 
and commonly used is the 'fabrication of evidence' ploy." 
                                                      Skolnick & Fyfe, 
_Above the Law_

There are many methods of police "social engineering" people: 

* "The hook" is the offer of a "rationale" to the suspect for whatever it is 
that the person is accused of. In a homicide case, it might go like this: "I 
read the background of the guy that got killed.... He was some piece of 
crap.... It was good for the neighborhood that he's dead...." I haven't 
heard of the hook lines in "hacker" investigations (maybe because law 
enforcement officers aren't nowhere as familiar with this environment as 
they with stuff such as murder) but one I can imagine LEOs would use is an 
appeal to the intellectual tinkering. "...I wonder what is inside of those 
bank computers...A lot of people must be curious..."

* The divide and conquer method by playing people off of each other in  
the case of multiple suspects.  Basically, the cliched "You partner is  
telling us a lot of things and getting a deal with the DA...." ploy.

* An interesting technique reportedly used by one police department  
was to have a chart of "indications that the interviewee is lying" on  
the wall.  The chart was deliberately set up with contradicting items:  
"Subject is nervous.... Subject is too calm.... Subject is belligerent.... 
Subject is too polite.... Subject avoids eye  contact.... Subject stares at 
interviewer...." (The items were spaced out so not to be this obvious.) 

* A very common technique is claim that evidence was found that doesn't 
really exist. 

* Another technique is to irritate the interviewee to get the person to 
say something unwise. The LEOs can get an upper-hand by using an angry or 
irritated outburst as a hook to manipulate a person.

* Mild physical duress can be used. The classic third degree is out these 
days but there are other ways. Chilly rooms. Allow the person to  
drink lots of water but delay bathroom breaks. Chairs with maladjusted legs 
to make the person feel uncomfortable.

* Applying to arrests, a big tactic to have more open confession time  
is to delay the arrestee seeing the attorney. Legally, the police have  
to tell the arrestee that the attorney has arrived. They, however, are  
not obligated to send up the attorney. The arrestee has to ask or  
demand to see the attorney. Otherwise, the LEOs might well delay,  
hoping that the person unwittingly blabs out something useful before 
the attorney can stop him. 

   By the way, the whole Miranda deal gets very interesting in regards 
   to legal distinctions of a person being a witness, an interviewee,  
   a suspect, and an arrestee. Miranda v. Arizona decision applies  
   to only formal arrest and to where confessions are an issue.  
   (Some cases don't require Mirandization. Usually cases where  
   the possession of some item is sufficient for the case. But if the  
   person start confessing to something, Miranda applies...)  
   One technique LEOs may use is to keep interviewing people rather  
   than arresting and interrogating them. Things said during the  
   interviews can be used against the person but the Miranda  
   protections don't apply. 

These and other police "social engineering" techniques are regarded  
by many LEOs to be so crucial to their work that if they were  
prohibited, it would be the end of civilization. <grin>

>Nov. 10, Dr. Mark Ludwig, publisher of "The Happy Hacker book," went along  
>as a witness with me to the Albuquerque FBI office.  There we met with three 
>agents: Doug Beldon, Roger Black, and Baldwin.  Beldon told Ludwig, "Sure, 
>she's a suspect."  They subjected me to over an hour of browbeating, warning 
>me that if I didn't take a lie detector test, my chances of arrest would 
>increase. I sat there and said nothing -- and took notes.  It was a 
>fascinating opportunity to observe how the FBI tries to intimidate innocent 
>people into incriminating themselves.

Saying nothing is the right thing to do. It may be hard to keep silent but 
saying practically anything is risky in such proceedings. 

And there is no "off the record" with LEOs. Incidentally, except for 
arranged discussions with an attorney in law enforcement faculties, 
conversations with friends/etc. in the faculties can be risky. The bugging 
of some of the facility areas is a common practice (as came up in a case 
where a suspect was talking with a priest). 

Incidentally, an all common mistake people make is to ask the police if they 
should get an attorney. Wrong people to ask. The question can be used as a 
springboard for ploys such as "Why do you think you NEED an attorney?" or 
"What are worried about that you want to call in a lawyer?" 

By the way, the all too common cliche of "if you are innocent and have 
nothing to hide, then a polygraph will help to show you're innocent" is 
bunch of bovine soil enhancer. It is a psychological hook to go fishing for 
anything useful. And in the USA justice system, the burden of proof is upon 
the accuser, not the accused. (But, alas, this is being pushed the other 
way.  Look at the DNA sampling push, as in New York City, where the 
supporters claim is that getting DNA cataloged and booked will help innocent 
people by "proving" their innocence. What next, black boxes for computers to 
prove where one has been on the Internet? <grin & groan>)

>Guess what -- Doug Beldon has a certificate in his office saying he is a 
>graduate of the Rush Limbaugh Institute.  It figures.

Is that a mental institution? <grin><sorry, couldn't resist the joke>

>Does this mean that I will no longer cooperate with the FBI in bringing the  
>Hacking for Girliez gang to justice?  Because the FBI has not backed down 
>claiming I am a suspect, I no longer dare talk to them.   However, I am 
>still tying to bring the Girliez to justice by helping others to catch them.

Good move. Don't talk directly with the Bureau about the cracking case.  
Besides the likelihood of the FBI using the info against you, another very 
big problem is how the relationship can be manipulated and presented to 
others. (Don't be surprised if somewhere down the line you are made out to 
be an "informant" for the Bureau.) This is very ironic that the FBI hampers 
one of the "good  guys" by its handling of the claims made by the "bad 
guys". It is a common hazard.

>I will continue to help keep the Happy Hacker message of white hat, good guy 
>hacking on the Internet.  You have the right to know the secrets of the 
>Internet and to learn how to protect yourself from nasty characters such as 
>the Girliez.  I won't let criminals like them shut me down, and I won't let 
>the FBI shut me down, either.

Thank you for the Happy Hacker mailings and the perseverance in this  
situation. Also, thank you for bearing with my unsolicited comments.

I have been an avid reader of happy hacker for a number of months now, and 
have never made a contribution.  This is because I am simply only interested 
in the information it provides rather than wanting to learn how to become an 
evil hacker.  I have just read about how the FBI are trying to implicate you 
in their investigation and I think it sucks.  The only reason they are 
trying to implicate you is because, like all police and criminal 
investigation units the world over, they have to blame someone and they pick 
on you because they have your name, it is as simple as that.  They cannot be 
bothered to get off their ar$es and find the real s.o.b's so they take the 
easy route and blame you.  I felt that I had to offer you my support as a 
similar sort of thing happened to me not so long ago.  I was intimidated 
just as you were, but when it came to the crunch, in a court of law, the 
case folded and I sued the ar$e off the British version of the FBI for false 
accusation and false imprisonment, defamation etc.  My biggest mistake was 
that I tried to help them catch the people involved (I even gave them the 
names) but as all good agents, they couldn't detect their heads being blown off.

My advice to you is don't get involved, don't help them, just answer the 
questions your solicitor tells you to answer and keep fighting.

Hi Carolyn, just read you latest "inside happy hacker" and found it 
interesting as always.  Your story of the FBI harassing you was 
interesting as well, amazing how they think they can do whatever they 
please. anyway, you might think I'm being picky, but I was a bit disturbed 
by your rush Limbaugh comment, and the insinuation that rush would approve 
of this activity.  As a rabid rush fan, I assure you this agent was behaving 
in a manner that was opposite to what rush stands for.  I think if you would 
try listening to him, you would find he is on your side on the issues of 
maximizing freedom and limiting government intervention in our lives, which 
your interrogation was an obvious governmental intrusion into YOUR life.  As 
a fan of your work, I ask you to at least listen to rush before passing 
judgment on him, much as you study victim computers before hacking them ;) 
(legally, of course!!)

Have a good one, and keep up the good work!

[Thanks for pointing out that Limbaugh is no fan of FBI harassment, I'm 
sorry to have made the snide comment -- Carolyn Meinel]

From: Ryan Barrett

I've got a nice little story about the America "Intelligence" organizations, 
the FBI + CIA.

Basically, a few years back during the Cold War they noticed that the 
Russians had this new missile.  The bad thing was they didn't know what it 
was.  So what did they do?

They contacted the military/intelligence organizations of Canada, Australia, 
France and Germany.  No-one knew what it was.

Finally they contacted the British SS (MI5 / MI6).  Given five minutes the 
British Intelligence service gave them FULL specs for the missile.  How?

They check through the catalogue of a certain MAJOR arms dealer and there it 
was.

Doesn't it increase your confidence in the agencies? :)..

Anyway I hope the stupid, in-breed morons use the single brain cell that 
they all share to realize that your innocent.  Hell, if it WAS of your doing 
you'd have to be the stupidest person on the planet (which you're not).

I've heard a rumor that the "Hacking for Girlies" group are transvestite 
homosexual males.  They should re-name themselves "Wanting to be Girlies" !

Cheers, 
Bob,

Ps: If you print this, please don't include my e-mail address.

>Yes, I figured, there was no way anyone with as much as a double digit IQ 
would think I had ever been one of the Hacking for Girliez gang.

Well... I can't see how that statement was proved wrong ;)

Here's the FBI situation as best as I can see it:

1) They have *not* sent me (Carolyn) a "target letter." This is a letter 
that formally tells someone that he or she is a suspect.  Since I have *not* 
gotten one, I presume they have given up on thinking I'm a suspect in the 
Web site hack of the New York Times on Sept. 13, 1998.  There is no news of 
any arrests or even any raids of other possible suspects.  I have heard from 
reporter friends that two other people have been visited by the FBI and 
questioned and that they got the impression that they are suspects.  I also 
have heard that the FBI asked the owner of  Denver ISP for permission to 
view his logs but that he refused. 

I'm guessing the FBI has run out of leads.  Usually if no arrests are made 
within 90 days of a crime, the case is dead.

There's something a little odd going on in the hacker scene that might have 
roots in the old Iran/Contra scandal and which possibly could point to 
renewed US Federal efforts similar to the "counter-subversive" activities 
that came to light in that scandal.  Because that scandal predates the Web, 
most of those records are buried in expensive databases such as Lexis-Nexis, 
or on microfiche or microfilm.  Is there anyone who gets free access to 
Lexis-Nexis who would be willing to research this problem for us?  It sure 
would be faster than slaving over a hot microfiche reader! If you can help,
