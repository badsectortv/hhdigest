Tools to catch hackers.

Exciting announcement: DefCon IV Dates!  July 11-13, 1997. This is one of the best, if not *the* best, hacker conferences around. Hackers, law enforcement professional, and computer security experts party it up between surprisingly good talks and panels. Reporters, directors and movie producers hang out hoping to meet the hackers that can help them make gobs of money by glamorizing (or demonizing) us in the eyes of the public.

DESPERATELY SEARCHING FOR SUICIDAL.FOOBAR.COM

From: "Roger A. Prata" <prata@cyber-wizard.com>

What ever happened to the big competition between you and Jericho and the 
suicidal.foobar.com box??  Any more action?

Moderator: jericho still hasn’t given me a notarized contract to test his security. Also, just after the johnny xchaotic email bombings suicidal.foobar.com suffered a nervous breakdown, err, hard disk crash. Imagine that!  I got some interesting results on a traceroute just now. It got into a loop at dimensional.com’s routers.

MORE MODEM JAMMER

From: bryan_g@juno.com

 I spoke with a friend of mine, who had this to say about Modem 
Jammer:

 "Well, it could be used as by someone as  a way to carry a virus 
to those '313!+3 pirate boardz' out there who won't give them access to 
'warez'. The name of the program alone might cause a neophyte to d'load 
it, and if a virus is attached to it, they might experience an infection 
if anti-virus software isn't on their 'puter."

  As always, you gotta be selective about what you decide to get. 
Just be careful!

IRC ISSUES

From: Timothy Ward <tbw@ruined.all-net.net>

I'm not sure, but I was under the impression the ICMP floods (ping -f) 
were classified as denial of service. And since no one wants some lamur 
with half a brain to get in trouble, it should be mentioned.

If I'm wrong, I apologize ;)

Can your ISP detect a ping -l or ping -f? (would this be considered 
illegal??)

Secondly,

Just curious, but this happened to me the other day...how do they perform 
such an act? (it had a message that the server itself oped them)

Um, try going on any EFnet server, and join #2600. 
BTW - If you want to apply yer hacking skills, try getting ops on a chan 
that you hate. Flooding (while sometimes lame) if fun too.

Get Trumpet Winsock and use the "Ping" util, not quite as effective as 
ping -f, but will get the job done. What it does is ping a person with 
the desired packet size and interval, until you tell it to stop. It tells 
you "ICMP Transmit Error" a lot if you set it to go too fast, or with too 
high of a packet size, but will lag someone to hell if they're annoying 
you. 
Have fun.

LINUX QUESTIONS

From: "Roger A. Prata" <prata@cyber-wizard.com>

I am trying to set up a PPP Chat script for Linux.  I am trying to set up a 
PPP connection to my ISP, static IP.  I am using dip.  I cannot seem to get 
the chat script working.  Are any of you using dip with PPP??  If so, cud u 
mail me a copy of a chat script that I cud modify for use with my ISP??  I 
am using Slackware Linux, kernel 1.2.3 
TIA,

CALLING FOR HACKERS FROM OZ

From: Dunebuggy <agradkow@sebas.vic.edu.au>

Hi 
  This is the first time I’ve written here and I was wondering if there 
were any other subscribers from Australia here as a lot of the talk sounds 
like it's from America. I also need some help with Unix hacking so if 
some could send me some info it would be a great help. 
thanxs.

ps. PsyChadEl the guy with the cool hair from the prodigy's name is Keith Flint. 
All I ask for is a chance to prove money can't make me happy.

Moderator: There are LOTS of Australian hackers on this list. Now if you want to check out a really dynamite hacker site in OZ, see http://www.skeeve.net.

WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?

DOES IDENTD WORKAROUND EXIST?

From: The Grizzled Mage <GrizzledMage@the-lair.com>

Is there any way to get around or change Identd to gain anonymity, at

WAY TO GET SPAMMERS

From: mulder@jumbo.ntplx.net (Hunter Rose)

        This is just an idea, but it seems damn good to me in my present 
bad mood. 
        I am sick and freaking tired of all these stupid posts on Usenet. 
"it really works!" "easy money!" blah blah blah. and all the stupid spam. 
it's rare that I can even find what I’m looking for anymore, much less go on 
and not run into these irritating, repetitive, completely unrelated posts. 
        So why don’t we just start posting the GTMHH on stopping spammers 
every time we see a spam? make it available to every idiot with a computer. 
I mean, put it everywhere. I want to see people just going down every day. 
I want to see people AFRAID to post this crap. I want these people OFF the 
Internet. 
        I'm no Internet purist that believes newbies should be eradicated, 
but these people prey on the stupid and make a wonderful medium practically 
unusable without contributing anything in return. 
        does anyone else get these urges? would anyone else like to start 
posting this stuff everywhere? because id be only to glad to help.

Moderator: I’m flattered that you would think of posting the GTMHH on zapping spammers all over the place. But it is a pretty long piece, and let’s face it, the average Usenet reader is not going to have the patience to learn how to track down these guys.

But, using all his hacker wiles, Greg Bulmash has come up with a hilarious, legal and effective way to REALLY put spammers on the run. His ultra deadly to spam Web site will be fully operational on March 7th. I’ll send this list the URL that day and we can all go over and start making life horrid for Cyberpromo, Crazy Kevin, and all their ilk. Muhahaha...

MORE CRACKING QUESTIONS

From: (identity suppressed by moderator)

Well, I am finally fulfilling a promise to myself that I would learn 
something about hacking.  I am still a total newbie, so bear with me.

I would like to hack a system for the pure challenge of it.  I have 
found a really nice system that would be, I think, pretty easy to hack. 
Let me explain a few things about the system first:

1.  The system is at a school library.  In order to keep from having the 
kids who use it get into programs they don't know about and therefore 
cause harm to the system, the librarians installed a password-protection 
device.

2.  The system runs Windows 3.1.  I have tried to figure out the name of 
the password protection program, but haven't succeeded yet.  It puts a 
lock icon on certain program groups.  When a protected group is 
double-clicked, a dialog box pops up stating that a password must be 
entered to continue.  There is no username prompt; just a password 
prompt.

3.  The only programs that are not protected are Microsoft Works, 
WordPerfect, etc. as well as the CD-ROM programs such as Encarta.  As 
far as I know, there are no programs which let you run executables.

4.  There is also a prompt for a login when a computer is turned on.  I 
think the systems run Novell Netware.  I don't know whether this 
password entry can be defeated or not.  I do know that there is a 
username you can enter so that the password program does not go into 
effect, but I don't know what the username is.

Can anyone help me out?  If you do know the answer, please don't tell me 
all of it.  Just give me a hint or two, so I at least can say I figured 
part of the answer out. :) 
Thanks!

Moderator: First off, get permission from your school to crack the library computer. Otherwise you’re asking to get expelled -- or worse. This actually may be easy to do. Are your grades good? Do you have a good reputation? If so, you may be able to get your school to agree to let you test their security. In fact, they may be grateful to you for offering to help them out. This also can work with your local ISP. Oftentimes ISPs let high school students work as interns. They often appreciate help with security testing. But be absolutely sure they agree -- in writing -- to any kind of security testing you may want to try out.

Don’t count on being able to quietly break in with no one noticing you. There are too many ways to get caught, especially if some other student who is really good at hacking has already talked some teacher into letting him or her be the school security expert.

But if you have been getting in any kind of trouble at school, the administration may be already looking for an excuse to kick you out. So in this case even offering to help them test security may get you in trouble. In fact, I recently learned (from a message that I have to keep private) about a student who was suspended and may be permanently expelled from high school for just writing an email bombing program, even though there is no evidence that he has used this program.

Now, if you still want get good ideas of how to break in, check out the back issues of this Digest posted at the award-winning Infowar Web site under the Hackers forum at http://www.infowar.com. But remember, this list and the Infowar Web site are both read by lots of law enforcement people and, who knows, maybe some folks at your school. I mean, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people browsing the Infowar site!That’s why I suppressed your identity. In some high schools, just getting caught asking a bunch of hackers how to crack into the library computer system might be grounds for suspension.

From: Spyder <magus@erols.com>

This is probably the lamest hack ever

Don't you hate things like protection programs like Foolproof (a limiter that 
makes you not able to delete things or have access to something)? Or maybe 
surfwatch?

 I have found an easy way to hack it. I find no fun in dialing up computers 
so I work to crack code, guess passwords, remove Internet "blockers" and get 
past security programs that deny access to different things. 
 

Get rid of them like this

In Windows 3.1

Open up the file manager. 
Double click on C: 
highlight system.ini 
copy to a disk 
Look around your hard drive so you know where 
open system.ini the one on your hard drive with notepad 
There should be a header that says [386Enh] 
There will be a command line like 
*C:\program\block.exe for example(this is an example) 
delete the line that has that kind of information 
or do the same thing with it the autoexec.bat

Presto! it should be gone!

What if there is a program that doesn't let you delete things( example: 
Foolproof) Press F5 while the computer boots. It will go to DOS. Then type 
edit system.ini  . Do the same as above from there. 
 

In Windows 95

This is much easier. Press Crtl+Alt+Del ONCE . You will get a little menu on 
things you can shut off. You can also use this when a program takes to long 
and seems to be frozen.

From: Ben Woodcock <nofear@cliffhanger.com>

I work with an ISP that runs the latest version of IPAD, on a DOS server. 
I was wondering if anyone out there has any ideas on how to get in and just 
leave a message in there saying I was here or something like that. He 
recons it's impenetrable but I know for a fact that it isn't. I don't have 
a shell account so I can't do anything that needs one of them. All I have 
is normal user access so I can get to my user web page directory to 
upload/move files. He has challenged me to crack this system (he is a 
friend and won't press charges on me) especially if all I do is leave a 
message for him. Any reply would be helpful either here on this list or to 
nofear@cliffhanger.com.

Any flames are welcome as well

I've got my whole life ahead of me (except the bit I've already had of course)

Moderator: Just make sure the owner of that ISP also agrees with letting you test the security. If I were you I’d get it in writing.

From: ravanello@avalon.sul.com.br

As you asked, this ISN'T anonymous, so, if you wish, flare me at will. 
Well, the point is the following: I work in a Internet server here in 
Brazil which uses WorldGroup 2.0 as Server. My boss is another subscriber off yours, and 
he authorized me to ask this: IS there any way to hack in a WGroup 
server, with a normal user account?

SOCIAL ENGINEERING DEBATE CONTINUES

From: " Intergalactic  <--" <intergalactic@hotmail.com>

>To those, that think social engineering is hacking, there are few >words I'd 
like to say. I've been watching this conversation around >hacking and hacking 
techniques for a while and I've had enough.

Then go where the "real" hackers are.

>It seems like there are too many people out there, who don't have the 
>slightest clue what hacking was and is. It's a wish and a need to >further 
develop your knowledge and to seek information.

Yeah, everyone and their grandmother has their own definition of what hacking 
is and isn't. To me, hacking is finding out what is wrong with something (i.e 
why it's not working like *I* want it to), taking it apart, and figuring out 
how to make it work the "right" way.

>So, how the h*** can in that context a scam, involving a stupid >guard, be even 
considered as important part of HACKING.

Because the guard (and anyone else) IS a part of the system. A weakness was 
found, and it was exploited.

>Sure it's an important part of getting  access to a computer, but it >has 
nothing to do with hacking. And you don't get any knowledge from >it.

Okay, so getting access to a computer has nothing to do with hacking? 
Knowledge? What do you know about people? Do you know how to tell when 
someone's lying? Do you know how to MAKE someone lie? Can you gain a complete 
strangers trust? Sorry to offend your hobby, but computers are NOT the hardest 
thing in the world to hack. People are.

>Almost the same goes for tricks. While they can be fun to play with, >they are 
only that. Not much knowledge behind them and should I do it >to impress 
people.

Agreed

>Actually, it's even repulsive to use both words as physical and >hacking so 
close together. ;)

...sounds like you’re afraid of something.

>Not only that, will you people drive around the globe to be able to >do that, 
or are your needs limited only to your hometown.

Ever heard of a telephone? Look, obviously you have never SE'd anyone. In fact, 
judging by your attitude, I seriously doubt you could. Using nothing but a 
computer to hack is limiting yourself. PEOPLE make the world go around, and if 
you can't hack one of those, well, I guess computers are the next best thing. 
BTW You should get out more...

>Please feel free to flame me, but I insist that you allow me to do >the same.

...go for it.

From: Bernz <bernz@ix.netcom.com>

I started this thread and maybe went about wording it the wrong way. My 
point was that social engineering is an aspect of hacking. It is an 
overlooked aspect. It is NOT the end all and be all. It is NOT the only 
part to hacking. 
Real world security holes are as important to monitor as ones in a 
computer. Don't think the computer can get you everywhere and can do 
everything. It can't. Hacking, in a traditional sense, probably means 
just computers. I don't like to be close minded. I just think it has to 
do with security in general. 
The entire, "is it hacking" argument is silly. It's like the darn "is it 
punk rock". There's no answer because there's lots of interpretations. 
Few of which can really be called wrong. 
BTW it's my personal opinion that people who are so against SE are 
people who just feel uncomfortable because real life is an aspect that 
they can't control. It's not accessible via a modem so it's just not 
worth it?

RANT

From: fox@edgenet.net (fox)

I have a small rant that I would like to submit about this mailing list. 
>From all the literature I have read on the net and gotten from other 
hackers I would like to submit an opinion of this list. No while its 
lovely list to teach newbies and so forth about this that and the other, 
there is a serious lack of information. Sure...it will tell you what 
this is and what it does exactly to the beginning hacker, but it really 
fails to tell HOW to utilize it.  I mean...there are exploits, security 
holes, and all other sorts of goodies out there just waiting to be 
discovered by an enterprising young or old hacker. Is it because the 
moderator doesn't want people getting caught by the feds? Or is it 
because the moderator has no idea how to find and use these exploits? I 
don't really care. I already know what all the legal consequences of 
breaking into systems are and I'm sick of being reminded. Why not just 
post a disclaimer saying that if you do this and get busted, it isn't 
our problem?  There is a fine line between being in the know about 
Internet functions and being a hacker. Oh yes....I'm so glad that I know 
how to finger a user now...big deal. I very seriously doubt that knowing 
how to finger or give a whois command makes me a hacker. For god's sake 
why not get some posts on here explaining password or program cracking? 
Getting INTO an actual system. If we get busted that's our problem. I'm 
really tired of getting warnings. Its my life...I'll take the risks. I 
suggest that if we don't have a moderator who is willing to teach us 
something useful then we get a new one, Mrs. Meinel <sp?> is doing an OK 
job but I want to actually sit in front of my computer and get 
somewhere. Port surfing...bleah...once I've found a UNIX 4 system how 
can I bypass or crack my way in using another user's account? We demand 
free access to data. Teach something that will be useful. Not every 
would be hacker out there wants to grow up to be a normal functioning 
member of society. This was my Rant. Thank you.

From: jolevano@spectra.net

dear carol,

        I recently subscribed to your happy hacker mailing list and was 
very impressed.  I enjoyed the list very much and learned a lot, but 
recently learned of a campaign started and lead by you to rid the Internet 
of maul bomb programs and programmers.  I think that is absurd.  Censorship 
sucks,  even the kind that you are trying to push.  It is for this reason 
that I am asking you to unsubscribe me to your mailing list.  I have nothing 
against you as a person, but have to voice my opinion about what you are 
doing.  I hope that this letter has some effect on what you are doing.

Moderator: When we express our opinions in a peaceful, noncoercive manner, which is *all* that I have *ever* advocated, this is not censorship. Check out the GTMHHs on fighting spammers etc. and you will see what I mean. If we were to succeed by these socail pressure techniques in ridding the Net of those email bombers who attack our freedom of speech, that would not censorship. It is the exact opposite -- we are defending freedom of speech against those who attack it. I hope you can learn to understand the value of peaceful, noncoercive protest. In fact, that is what you are exercising today by unsubscribing.
