1. A note from the moderator 
From: Moderator <jammer@ecst.csuchico.edu>

Hello again,

This is the eighth Happy System Administrator Digest. It also contains the first 
released HSAD-Guide.

The guide lists many useful applications for Linux which can get your system 
moving. It helps to demonstrate that Linux isn't just something you boot into 
once in awhile to do hacking. With a little patience, you can make your Linux 
system more functional than a Win95 system.

Okay, so the guide is a little short, but I think it makes up for that in 
content.

I keep getting more requests for subscriptions, so something's working right. 
If you'd like to archive the HSAD's, or put a link to my page on yours, let 
me know, and I'll put a link to yours off mine.

Happy Administration,

-Jon

(Added 7/4): So, you're probably wondering why this digest is dated 7/2, 
but you're getting it on the fourth? Well, I had it written up, and I was 
in my mail software when *blink*, poop goes the power. And poop goes the 
ISP. I couldn't get it out yesterday (Thursday), because I was busy flying 
home. Oh well, keep it coming.

2. secret T/t-bit of chmod 
From: Meino Christian Cramer <mccramer@solfire.ludwigsburg.netsurf.de> 
 

Hi there all!

I have Linux installed and I am happy with it.

But from time to time there are questions and 
things, which I want to know, but no doc or 
source code give me the answer.

Now -- it is such a "time".

I've been struggled over the "t" and "T" 
bit of the chmod-command.

The man-pages said for the t-bit 
"save  program  text on swap device (t)"

(and what's about directories???)

but this isn't true.

If I do a chmod 7552 I will get a "T" instead 
of "t" -- also no answer from the man-pages.

Does anybody out there know, what that`s good for? 
 

Thanks for your help! 
 

KEEP HACKING!

3. Can't load X 
From: gfm <bean@audiophile.com>

The first time I started X, I got a message saying 'not enough memory 
for 800x600'..or something to that effect. So then I went and modified 
the XConfig file to comment out the lines referring to svga and 
uncommented those pertaining to vga16, and did some other modifications 
besides those, and now I'm receiving 'xinit and X server not found' etc. 
errors. If anyone has ideas on how to solve this or can point me to a 
site that could be of help, a reply would be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks.

-gfm

[ Jon: Make sure that your X server is set correctly. Do an 'ls -l' on 
       /usr/bin/X11/X, and see where the link points to. Make sure it points 
       to the proper server for your video card (or the VGA/SVGA server, 
       if your specific card isn't supported). ]

 Slackware is one of many available distributions of Linux. 
The others are RedHat (www.redhat.com), Debian (www.debian.org), 
Caldera Open Linux (correct me if I am wrong). 
 XFree86 is an X-server. The only alternative I know is 
the commercial X-server - Metro-X, but you have to pay for it. 
 With X-servers you can use one of many window managers 
available. They are: fvwm, fvwm-95 (just like W'95), mwm (available 
with Motif), Enlightemenet and so on... Check Yahoo pages.

I don't know the tools you have , but  my Distribution (a german one 
DLD 5.2 Pro) contained a nice tool named ViPer (Visual Packager) .

AFAIK this works for RPM-Packages only ...

Maybe you can find it .. it's pretty easy with this one . 
 

To remove the entry's in fvwm's Menu just let it reconfigure 
(this should check all installed packages on your system and 
[re-]create the menu's . 
Should be started with :  /etc/X11/fvwm95/system.fvwm95rc  )

(maybe there is an Admin-tool which makes this a bit easier)

Have a nice day

[ Jon: As Joey noticed in his next posting, fvwm is configured through 
       the file system.fvwmrc. And, as I pointed out, the Linux Gazette has 
       lots of information on cool ways to configure fvwm. ]

From: Joey Maier <maierj@okstate.edu>

Hi.

I had given you an HSAD message to post re: changing the programs listed 
in the popup menus for fvwm.

I started poking around and found out that there is a file in my X11/fvwm 
directory that contains all the specifications for the menus, and that 
you can easily edit with vi.  :) I think it is named system.fvwmrc [not 
@ home right now, or I would check]

I still have not found out how to change my default screensaver. :(

7. Happy Systems Administrator Guide #2 (first released) 
From: Me <jammer@ecst.csuchico.edu>

Things you can do with Linux.

1. Introduction 
2. Graphics 
3. Games! 
4. Applications 
 

---

1. Introduction

Well, now that you've spent umpteen hours installing and configuring Linux, 
what are you going to do with it?

Sure, you could do the usual thing, and probably the original reason you got 
it, you could use it as a shell account to do all of your hacking.

But come on! You're not going to waste several hundred megs of hard drive space, 
just so you can hack, are you? You've got the full power of one of the first 
native 32-bit Intel operating systems.

There are plenty of freeware/shareware/Gnuware applications available for 
you to play with. From 3D graphics to programming to games!

So, this document will point some of these wonderful gems out to you.

2. Graphics

Sure, Linux has a great shell system, and is excellent for text-based 
operations. But did you know that there are some high-end graphics packages 
available, at little or no cost?

2.1. Ray-tracers

The first ones I'll talk about are what's called a Ray-tracers.

POV-Ray (Persistence of Vision), is an application that takes in simple 
descriptions of three dimensional worlds, and outputs stunning 3D images. 
You don't even need X-windows to run it (although it helps when viewing the 
images).

The POV-Ray homepage is at "http://www.povray.org/". Here you'll see some 
stunning examples of its output. You can download precompiled binaries (which 
run faster), and the source.

A more advanced (read: complex and difficult) ray-tracer is BMRT (Blue Moon 
Rendering Tools), which uses Pixar's RenderMan standard to describe its scenes. 
In addition to ray-tracing, BMRT performs Radiosity, a very cool (but 
computationally intensive) 3d mechanism. Download binaries at: 
  http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html

2.2. Modellers

So, it's a little difficult to describe a 3D world using text, eh? Well, 
several people have created modellers as front-ends to the ray-tracers. 
To use these, you will have to have X installed.

AC3D is a highly reccomended modeller that outputs in both POV-Ray and 
RenderMan format. Check it out at: 
  http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/users/andy/ac3dlinux.html

2.3. Image manipulation

If you have an image that you want to modify, there are several utilities out 
there that'll get you on your way.

First, is an app that you may or may not know about, and it comes with most 
distributions of X. The app I'm talking about is XV. XV is an awesome imaging 
utility that allows you to cut, copy, crop, rotate, and otherwise manipulate 
almost any type of image. The homepage is "http://www.trilon.com/xv/".

For those command-line junkies, there's netpbm, a suite of conversion/manipu- 
lation utilties, all command line based. 
  ftp://ftp.crl.research.digital.com/pub/X11/contrib/utitities/ 
        netpbm-1mar1994.p1.tar.gz

If you want to view postscript files, you'll want to have Ghostscript and 
GhostView installed. See http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/

Last but not least, an image composition program, GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation 
Program). See http://scam.xcf.berkeley.edu/~gimp/ 
 

3. Games!

Sure, you know about all the applications for Linux, but did you know there 
are some pretty cool games for Linux?

Abuse is a cool game (which I beleive has been ported to other platforms), 
written almost entirely in LISP. ftp.crack.com should have it, but they've 
been down lately. Search for "+linux +abuse +quake" and you should find it.

Also, the same goons, who have absolutly no life, ported Quake to Linux. 
See the Linux Quake page at http://threewave.planetquake.com/linux/

There is also Linux DOOM. See the Linux DOOM FAQ at: 
  http://jcomm.uoregon.edu/~stevev/Linux-DOOM-FAQ.html

For even more Linux games, see the Linux Game Tome at 
  http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/tlau/linux-game.html 
 

4. Applications

So, you were wondering when I'd get down to some actuall apps, weren't you?

PAPyRUS is a full-fledged word-processor for X. It looks like a Word clone, 
but the documentation is in French. 
  http://or.mime.univ-paris8.fr/~loscar/Papyrus/papyrus_eng.html

For $220, you can get Caldera's Internet Office Suite, which includes 
WordPerfect for Unix, an e-mail package, NExS (a spreadsheet program), and 
Motif. 
  http://www.caldera.com/products/

You can also get Mathematica for Linux. Check for Student versions, they come 
lots cheaper.

There are tons more apps listed at the Linux Applications and Utilities Page: 
  http://www.xnet.com/~blatura/linapps.shtml

1. A note from the moderator 
From: Moderator <jammer@ecst.csuchico.edu>

Hello again,

Sorry I'm late on the ninth HSAD. But I had good reason. Last weekend was 
DEFCON, and I had planned to send out one from there. But, the T1 never 
arrived, so I couldn't connect to the internet. Then, Wednesday, I came down 
with Sinusitis, which put me out until yesterday.

Unfortunately (for you), my new toy came yesterday. The IBM PC110 is a fully 
functional PC, that fits in a 4"x6" square. 256-color, VGA, sound-card, modem, 
everything. So, I spent yesterday and most of today putting Linux on that.

So now here I am, setting up to get you the HSAD, as promised, which I hope 
to be a good one.

Oh, and for all those who offered to write guides, I'm still waiting...

Happy Administration,

-Jon

Hi,

Don't know if this works on other distributions, but on my redhat 4.1 
putting the line   xscreensaver -timeout 30 -cycle 10 &   in 
/etc/X11/xinit/.xinitrc starts the screensaver after 30 mins of inactivity 
and cycles through them all showing each one for ten mins.. 
Do a man xscreensaver for other commands.

Hope that's what you were after..

The t flag (a.k.a. the sticky bit) has an ancient purpose when applied to 
files which is mainly of historical amusement on modern machines.  It also 
has a quite practical purpose when applied to directories.

First, the amusement.  Back in the days when UNIX ran on machines with 16k 
or less of RAM (!), it was a significant performance improvement to be 
able to keep some programs accessible more quickly.  Widely used programs 
(such as vi) had their sticky bit set, so they'd 'stick' around.  This 
meant that even if noone was using vi at the moment, it would at least 
stay in swap since swap was often a faster device and there's less 
computation to swap something in than to start it up from scratch.  With 
modern OS's such as linux which dynamically allocate disk cache on 
machines with up to a gigabyte of RAM, there is little value to the 
sticky bit.  For FILES, that is.

But the sticky bit is not just an anachronism.  When applied to 
directories it causes a quite valuable behaviour.  It prevents people from 
deleting or moving files they don't own.  You might think "but UNIX 
handles that anyway".  Well, sort of.  Deleting and renaming are dependant 
on the permissions of the DIRECTORY.  Since everyone has their own home 
directory and has their own files in it, why would anyone care?  Because 
of tmp directories.  Tmp directories are world writable.  This would 
normally allow anyone to delete or rename files in them -- whether they 
owned the file or not.  But that would make temporary directories 
significantly less useful.  So it was decided that the sticky bit would be 
'overloaded' with a special behaviour when it was set on directories.

If you're interested in seeing all the sticky files and directories on 
your system, try 
 find / -perm -1000 -ls 
(This may not work on some commercial systems that use non-gnu versions 
of find.)

It depends what do you mean. Deleting and apllication from HDD or 
from pop-up menu in your window manager. I hope you know how to 
delete files from HDD. If you want delete sth' from menu you 
must edit your window managers' config file.

ps. Watch out, because RedHat uses common configuration files for 
    fvwm and fvwm-95. It's called TheNextLevel. The hidden files 
    are located in /etc/X11/TheNextLevel. If you have IQ >= 95 
    you can safe edit them ;-) Don't forget to make backup copy.

There is also:

  But it requires lot of memory and fast hard disk. 
  Motif is also recommended, but there are statically

5. help with long linux booting 
From: OracLe <aren@mnl.v-link.net>

Hi!

i succesfuly managed to install my linux in my hard disk(clap and 
appluase~!!) anyway, when i boot using the bootdisk i created after 
the instalation, i still have to go through the process of my bootdisk 
scanning the system which takes pretty long... 
i.e.:

   scanning 183 299  creative 
   scanning 190 204  artec 
   scanning  ....etc etc.

this goes up to 20 to 30 minutes.

can i boot without this agonizing experience?

thanks.

Admittedly, *THAT* is simple, but that's not exactly what I wanted to 
know.  If you recall, I went on to ask another more important question.

['> #' added beacause it's part of my original message, even though Kris 
 did not actually quote it.]

> #inherit the window with all permissions to it so that messages

WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS IF 'su' OR 'login' TRUELY MASK YOUR IDENTITY; 
i.e., IS THERE SOME WAY TO TO MASK YOUR ID  WITH SIMPLE COMMANDS 
INSTEAD OF USING SOME SCRIPT OUT OF PHRACK [sorry to shout.  I wanted 
that to stand out from the rest of the message.]  The correct answer 
might vary depending on how tight the security on your installation 
is, but on my little testbed [a 386 with the 1.1.61 kernel] neither 'su' 
nor 'login' is capable of masking your identity from other users on the 
system.  This was true of my box for both X an command line.

I have printed up a couple scripts I made that show this happening and 
sent them to the "Happy Hacker" digest, since that seems like a more 
appropriate place to discuss such things.

Kris (or anybody else), I'd really like to continue this thread in 
that list....I'm hoping that you can tell me of a good way to mask my identity.

7. FIPS Blues 
From: Tuan Pham <fifo@concentric.net>

To Jon and HSAD subscribers :(.  I want to take linux off my partiton and get my hd space back.  I 
 used FIPS to resized it the last time.  But after reading the FAQ on fips, it said that I needed 
a boot and root image of my original hd.  How can I resize it, if I don't have it?  Also would usi 
ng a disk editor mean fdisk?  It said that if I don't have the boot and root image of my original 
hd then I would have to study the (my) hard drive sector and recalculate things.  By the way, earl 
ier I thought if I went to fdisk and select 3 to delete partitions it would del non-dos partiton 2 
 and 3 for me..but I guess it only took it off the list.  Could anyone help?

[Jon: What you can do now is add another DOS partition, in the space of the 
      two Linux partitions. This is better anyways, becuase it saves you disk 
      space (read up on cluster size and wasted space). 
      If you want to get back to your original setup, with one big partition, 
      you're going to want to get PartitionMagic, for $59. It will allow you 
      to delete the two Linux partitions, and then resize the DOS parition to 
      take up the whole hard drive. ]

Often i have a program to compile and gcc spits the dummy when it cant

do i install them in slackware 3.1 ?? Can anybody point me in the right 
direction ??

Jason

[ Jon: Any particular library in particular. Just search for the library's 
       name, you're bound to find it. Some libraries are proprietary though, 
       and you will have to may for them. ]

9. HSAD 
From: BJ Johnson <bjjohnson@usinternet.com>

1.   I've gotten my PPP connect going fine.  Now I'm trying to setup 
pine to get my e-mail.  I'm using a dialup account on my ISP with 
dynamic IP addressing.  I configured the news-group part of it, and that 
works great.  I can even send mail out.  But it will not pick it up form 
my ISP.  My mail-check-interval is set right and I have the SMTP server 
set properly.  What am I forgetting?

2.    How do I see how much room I have left on my hard-drive without 
X?  (RH 4.1 if it matters.)

[ Jon: Simple, use 'df'. It'll give you a usage summary for all mounted 
       partitions. ]

10. chmod +x  and mtools 
From: noname <noname@blah.com>

How do i make a shell script executable? I wrote one called 
lsa which executes the ff command:

#!/bin/sh 
ls -a

I chmod +x 'ed it then entered lsa at the prompt and what I get is this:

bash: lsa: command not found

[ Jon: I can't see your problem, but why do it that way. You can do it much 
       easier using "alias". Do a man alias to find out more. ]

And regarding mtools.. I was playing around with it yesterday and I'm 
not so sure what I did but now whenever I type mdir, it says 
"Path component "NEW"is not a directory. File "a" not found. 
I remember creating the "New" directory, then mcd-ing to it, then 
mcd-ing back to the parent (mcd ..), typing mdir a:\new, mrd, mcd and a 
slew of other commands but none of them work. I keep receiving the same 
output even after sliding in another floppy in the drive. Can someone 
help pls? Thanks.

11. Linux from the CD 
From: Alan D M <alandm@HotStar.net>

Hold the flames for a minute or two: I have Red Hat Linux 3.0.3 on a two 
CDRom set and I'm experiencing a mild delay getting a second hard drive to 
put it on. In the meantime, however, I'd like to run the Linux, hack around 
on it, just using the CD roms. I believe that's possible: there's a 
fleeting reference to this oddball way of using Linux in the O'Reilly book 
I have, but there's little in the way of direction as to how to go about 
it. 
Obviously, I don't want to use this method for long -- but until I get my 
second hard drive I don't want to be staring at the two CD Roms just 
wishing I could install them. 
Any help out there?

[ Jon: Hmm. I think you can do it. If you have an IDE (ATAPI) CD-ROM drive. 
       One of the CD's may have a "live" filesystem on it. If so, you may be 
       in luck. Try making a bootdisk, and rdev it so that it points to the 
       live cd. You're not going to be able to do much, and it'll be as slow 
       as hell. ]

12.. Winmodems and Linux NOT 
From: Bill Eldridge <bill@rfa.org> 
 

If the modem in question was a Winmodem, 
the US Robotics manual says they won't work 
with DOS or anything else, which seems sadly 
true.  From Hyperterminal, you can do AT 
commands that seem to show the modem alive 
and functioning, but you simply don't seem 
to be able to get ATDTxxxxxxx to work. 
Efforts to use this with Linux seem even 
more doomed.  I don't think it's a PnP 
issue, though I could be wrong.  Anyway, 
wasted a few hours trying to get a DOS 
dial-up program to work with them, and 
finally just threw my old Sportser 14.4k 
in instead.

Bill

[ Jon: You're right. Winmodems suck becuase they aren't real modems. They 
       rely on software to do most of the modeming. That's why they aren't 
       supported/liked in Linux. Check out US Robotics' homepage for more 
       information. ]

 *** Search for New Moderators 
============================================================

Happy Hacker folks, this is your Fearless Founder, Carolyn Meinel, back 
editing this Digest. Matt Hinze, who for some four months has brought his 
tact, wit and knowledge to the Digest, has asked that someone new take a 
turn running it.  We're sorry to see him go, but that's life:(

Here is what Matt has to say about the end of his stellar tenure as editor:

"It's time for me to step down as the moderator of the happy Hacker Digest. 
I want to make it clear that this is not motivated by negative 
comments/coercions of any sort, but rather the time-management situation I 
find myself in now. I'm too busy to moderate the Digest - and there are 
other things (my career, my school work, etc) that take up a lot of my time. 
It seems that while the quality of the digest has skyrocketed since I've 
taken over, the frequency has diminished. For the digest to be successful, 
it needs to be distributed in a timely fashion AND be technically accurate.

"If you think you want to try your hand at moderating the digest, I say go 
for it. It's not easy, but it is fun, and if you do it right, it can bring 
you a lot of positive experiences. Carolyn Meinel can be an invaluable 
resource. And I assure you, I was not doing her dirty work at any time, nor 
did she try to censor the digest or anything like that.

"I did have a blast working with the digest - it's just time for me to move 
on. While I won't be answering all of my mail, send me your questions or 
comments at matt@cs.utexas.edu.

"This has all been wonderful, but now I'm on my way." 
    - Phish

Matt

So, who wants to fill Matt's shoes? Temporary guest editors are welcome, but 
another person who can handle the entire job would be really welcome. This 
can be an exciting job. True, it pays nothing, but there is the prestige of 
running a hacker ezine that after being in existence less than a year, now 
has almost 5,000 subscribers.  Also, there are many fringe benefits:

Top ten reasons to become Happy Hacker Digest editor:

10. You will rake in tons of money selling hacker secrets to guys in trench 
coats.

9. Supermodels will beg you for dates. Women hackers: visualize Fabio!!!!

8. Hackers everywhere will revere you for your wit and wisdom and phear your 
haxor sk1llz. You will never be flamed again.

7. Celebrities will take you out to expensive restaurants and insist that 
you eat raw fish.

6. On IRC no one will dare flood or ICMPing you.

5. The Mafia will give you a Cray just like they did for that dude in the 
movie Sneakers.

4. Carolyn will teach you how to move communications satellites around and 
launch nuclear missiles.

3. You will also learn how to blow up people's TV sets over the Internet.

2. Carolyn will shower you with expensive gifts.

And, the number one reason to become Happy Hacker Digest editor:

1. Do you have any idea how much the FBI pays people to become narcs?

Honest, I swear on my honor as a hacker that all these things are true! Us 
hackers never, ever ever lie!

So if you're tempted to try out for running the Digest, please email me. 
Fame and fortune await you!!!!

 *** Mac Hacking 
============================================================

 by aMbRoSe <ambrose@ConnActivity.ConnActivity.com>

 I have been hacking for a number of years now, and I must say that although 
I love my Mac, it's probably the most vulnerable computer around. Macs are 
easy to hack, mainly because the simple security programs that are available 
just don't do their job well enough, and with the large vulnerability of the 
operating system, I have never seen a Mac that I couldn't get root access to 
within fifteen minutes. I have even been caught hacking Macs... so I am 
really r33t now ;)

Mac Hacking - Step By Step

1. Determine your target

 The first step to hacking a Mac is picking a Mac. You should probably pick 
one that is out of the way, because you will be doing some disk 
swapping/other stuff that may alert a passing administrator.

2. Determine the target's security/protection

 This step is easy. You should first note the model number and the version 
of system software that it is running. This will be very important later. 
Then try to get some time on the computer. Try different things, and look 
for a security program. Common ones are Foolproof and AtEase. Foolproof will 
show you it's logo every time you try to do something that your not supposed 
to and AtEase is characterized by it's drool-proof replacement for the 
finder. The method that you will use to break in will get past _any_ 
security, but if you want to remove the security for good then you will have 
to know what to look for.

3. Build a system disk

 Remember that model number? Well now it's time to pull it out. You also 
should have noted what version of the system software was on that computer. 
Lets say that you want to hack a PowerMac 7200 that's running system 7.5.3. 
Now go on Altavista or Apple's site or (gasp) AOL (puke) and do a search for 
'System 7.5.3' or something like that. Look through the results until you 
find the installer or the disk images. Download the disk image called 'Disk 
Tools'. The Disk Tools disk has a minimal set of software that will allow 
you to boot the target off the disk drive. Once you have download the 'Disk 
Tools' image, use a good disk image tool like ImageMaster or DiskCopy and 
make a disk from the image.

4. Break in

 Get to the target. Pop your disk in the drive and hold down 
Command-Control-Power (power is the little key with the sideways triangle up 
at the top of the keyboard). The computer should restart, and then the disk 
drive will spin up. If all goes well, you should start up without the 
security program, running entirely off the Disk Tools disk. Now that you are 
started up, you can do anything, including...

5. Remove the security!

 Note: Don't do this if you don't want people to know that the computer was 
hacked! To remove the security program, open up the system folder (usually 
named 'System' or 'System Folder' in the root directory) and look for a file 
with the name of the security program in the 'Extensions', 'Control Panels' 
and 'Startup Items' folders. When you find a file that looks like part of 
the security program (and there may be more than one file), delete it. 
What's this? It says that it can't be deleted because the file is locked? 
Well, just select the file's icon and hit Command-I. This will bring up the 
File Info window. There will be a little check-box at the bottom labeled 
'Locked' with an 'X' in it. Uncheck it and close the window. Voila! You may 
now empty the trash, eject your disk and restart.

       - Ambrose

[Moderator's note: Please don't use this to get in trouble at your school or 
library. However, if you want to win points, you could show a teacher or 
librarian how easy it is to circumvent Mac security.]

 *** New Netscape Java Security Hole 
============================================================

(This news item came from 
http://www.news.com/News/Item/0.4.12840,00.html?latest)

                Another hole poked in 
                Communicator 
                By Alex Lash 
                July 25, 1997, 7:10 p.m. PT 
Netscape Communications (NSCP) today confirmed that another hole has been 
punched in its Communicator browser, the fourth one since the product 
shipped in June.

Discovered by Kuo Chiang of the Singapore's Information Technology 
Institute, the security flaw affects both Macintosh and Windows versions of 
Communicator. It produces 
identical results to two previous flaws related to JavaScript, a scripting 
language Netscape invented and uses in its browsers. It allows a Web site 
administrator to place a nearly-invisible applet on a user's hard drive then 
track the user's progress across the Web, including any data the surfer 
types into the browser such as credit card numbers.

The company knew about the bug yesterday and has already fixed it, according 
to senior security product manager David Andrews. A new version of 
Communicator will be available in two weeks to coincide with a scheduled 
software upgrade. Users will have to download the entire suite to patch the 
security flaw.

Despite having identical results to two previous JavaScript holes, the 
latest bug is due to the company's use of LiveConnect, a separate language 
used to connect Java and 
JavaScript, Andrews said.

"LiveConnect is the way Java and JavaScript communicate with each other. 
It's exposing information that it shouldn't be."

Not nearly as scrutinized as Java and ActiveX, JavaScript and other 
scripting languages are nonetheless used extensively to deliver information 
to browsers. Andrews insisted that the architecture of JavaScript and 
LiveConnect are not problematic, but their implementation in the browser 
software has created security breaches.

Microsoft's browsers were also affected by the previous JavaScript bugs. The 
company released a patch for Internet Explorer 3.0 earlier this week. It is 
unclear if the latest bug affects Explorer as well.

 *** The Week the Internet almost Died 
============================================================ 
by Carolyn Meinel

The week of July 13 may have been the worst week for the Internet since the 
Morris Worm of 1988.

· A huge upswing in Denial of Service (DOS) attacks 
· Apparent sabotage of the DNS system made .com and .net sites inaccessible 
· Damage that took out of service 70 GB/sec of the US portions of the 
Internet backbone. 
 *** A huge upswing in Denial of Service (DOS) attacks:

There appears to be a concerted campaign against Mac Web servers. Reports 
picked up from Tasty Bits from the Technology Front are at: 
http://www.internetnews.com:80/isp-news/1997/07/1702-syn.html 
http://www.tbtf.com/archive/09-23-96.html 
http://hacke.infinit.se/

Also, the ISP owned by the Institute for Global Communications, which hosts 
many political organizations of what they describe as a "progressive" bent 
recently underwent severe DOS attacks including mail bombing in retaliation 
for their hosting of a web site for Basque rebels.

 *** Apparent sabotage of the DNS system made .com and .net sites inaccessible

Then there was the corruption of the DNS (Domain Name Server) system that 
misrouted a large amount of Internet traffic. Internic, which manages 
registration of domain names and their propagation across the routers of the 
Internet, has accused Alternic of maliciously rerouting the system. The .com 
and .net domains were affected.

 *** Damage that took out of service 70 GB/sec of the US portions of the 
Internet backbone

But what was perhaps the greatest stress on the Internet in years came from 
a series of accidents that disabled a large portion of the US Internet 
backbone. Following are some excepts from technical news provided by Dale 
Amon, technical director and cofounder of The Genesis Access project, the 
oldest ISP in Northern Ireland.
