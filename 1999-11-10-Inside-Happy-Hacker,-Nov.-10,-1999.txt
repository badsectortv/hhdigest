*** New Unix and Windows Digests

Coming soon: new Windows and Unix Digests. We have some great new editors.
You can email your questions and contributions for the Windows Digest to 
hheditor@techbroker.com, and send Unix/Linux material to 
unixeditor@techbroker.com. When these Digests come out, the new editors 
will introduce themselves.

*** How to Set up a Home Windows Hacker Lab

Want to set up a Windows hacker laboratory in your home and connect all 
of your computers to the Internet through just one modem? Learn how at 
http://happyhacker.org/winlan.html. This material will also help you with 
the problems of installing network interface cards for your Linux and 
other Unix type computers. You'll get screen shots, keystroke by keystroke 
instructions, and troubleshooting tips.

*** How to keep people from breaking into your email


Get laughs at all the people who plead with Meinel to help them commit 
computer crime, updated every few days at http://happyhacker.org/sucks.html. 
Look for Meinel's answer that begins, "Whoops --- you are so much more talented 
than Brenda and Tyme that you just social engineered me! OK, here's how all you 
pitiful wretches can risk going to prison by snooping on your lovers' and 
enemies' email…" Meinel tells how even your PGP encrypted material can be 
compromised - and tells you how to prevent people from snooping on your email.

*** Want to Be Part of the Uberhacker! Book?

Preview Meinel's upcoming book, Uberhacker! at http://happyhacker.org/intro.html. 
Would you like to contribute your knowledge? As with The Happy Hacker book, you 
will be credited by name (if you wish). If you contribute a great deal, you will 
get a free autographed copy. For example, one problem Meinel is working on right 
now is how to detect hidden shares in NT boxes. They are easy to make - just add 
a $ to the end of the share name. Users who create hidden shares are a major 
hazard - could a malicious user be setting up back doors for confederates outside 
the network? How does the administrator of an NT network find these hidden shares 
without knowing their full file names? Explain how, and you get in the book.
Meinel is looking for simple, but often overlooked ways to break into and defend 
computers. OK, OK, to be a book for Uberhackers, it will include the more 
sophisticated techniques. But it's awfully lame to spend weeks breaking into (or 
setting up) defenses for a network while overlooking some incredibly easy holes - 
like a hidden share of an NT file that holds stuff that looks like this:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\SAM]
"C"=hex:03,00,01,00,00,00,00,00,84,00,00,00,02,00,01,00,01,00,14,80,64,00,00,\
00,74,00,00,00,14,00,00,00,30,00,00,00,02,00,1c,00,01,00,00,00,02,c0,14,00,\
0e,00,05,01,01,01,00,00,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,00,02,00,34,00,02,00,00,00,00,\
00,14,00,31,00,02,00,01,01,00,00,00,00,00,01,00,00,00,00,00,00,18,00,3f,00,\
0f,00,01,02,00,00,00,00,00,05,20,00,00,00,20,02,00,00,01,02,00,00,00,00,00,\
05,20,00,00,00,20,02,00,00,01,02,00,00,00,00,00,05,20,00,00,00,20,02,00,00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\SAM\Domains]
@=hex(0):
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account]
"F"=hex:02,00,01,00,40,01,14,00,70,85,18,10,d9 etc. etc.
So… if you know, please share your knowledge!
