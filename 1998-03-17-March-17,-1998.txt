Get the Happy Hacker Book -- in a REALLY *F*U*N way
by RJ

Carolyn's newest book, "The Happy Hacker" is now available for release in
the US, Canada and Mexico. You could just order it (yawn) the way everybody
else in the world will. OR, you could be a part of a totally legal, and
rather cool way of ordering it.

Anyone who knows me knows that my book "External Threats to Computer
Security In a Networked Environment" (available in the bookstore at
www.infowar.com) talks in depth about banks and bank security. Well, part
of my research identified a little known method of getting money out of just
about any bank account. (Smile) Wanna see how? Well, as an example of just
how easy it is to use bank systems from the outside to draft money out of an
account, I'll let you order your copy of the book in that manner! AND, as
an added bonus, I'll have your bank send you the details as to how I did it
in your next statement. (I'm assuming you get a full statement and
documents. Of course, what self-respecting hacker WOULDN'T get his full
statement and docs, right?!)

HERE's HOW -

Email me at rjg@techbroker.com with BOOK ORDER as the subject. In the body
of the message provide me with two things -- 

1. Your name and shipping address 
2. The two sets of numbers on the bottom of your check. 
These are the bank ABA number and your account number.

No big deal here because you give everybody this same info whenever you
write a check. Here's where it gets fun -- I'll draft your account for
$34.95 and have Carolyn send you an **autographed** copy of the book! When
your next bank statement arrives, you'll see how it was done. Let me
emphasize that, so long as we're dealing with you and your account - there
is nothing illegal being done here. It's just a fun way to order. And for
the "super cautious" among you, I promise not to draft more than the $34.95
for the book. Hey, if I was going to use what I know about banks to get
money illegally, I wouldn't be messing around with your account anyway; I'd
be tapping into the secret account the IRS uses to process tax payments
nationwide! ;-)

YOU CAN GO TO JAIL WARNING!!! If you decide to send me wrong information,
you will be breaking several, Federal laws. For this you will stand a real
good chance of getting a new roommate named "Spike". Don't be stupid.

One final note. You could order your copy from Amazon.com instead, and send
your credit card numbers over the Internet, then nobody would see
them.....right?!? There's a fun thought.

Ziff Davis breaks the WarGame story
by RJ

Z-D broke the Happy Hacker wargame story yesterday on their website. See
their news story at 
http://www.zdnet.com/products/content/articles/199803/king.hill/index.html

It seems as though they've managed to "scoop" everyone else on this one.
Kudo's to Z-D!
Carolyn tells me that we'll soon have the boxes up and running, so more fun
is just around the corner.

Hoaxes - The Follow Up
by RJ

In our last issue, I spent some time discussing the topic of computer
hoaxes; but had to leave one loose end dangling in the breeze. The brief
re-cap is that a message supposedly seeking to help raise money for cancer
research was making the rounds. The "original author" was purported to be a
Dr. Jean Linney from a South Carolina university. I had sent an email to
Dr. Jean Ann Linney seeking her response to the message, but had not
received her reply at that time.

I now have received her answer. Her name was used without her knowledge or
consent, and she had no idea what was happening until it was too late. As
is frequently the case with victims, she also has no idea why she was
chosen. The net result of all of these good-hearted people forwarding the
messages to their friends is that some spammer now has thousands more names
to add to his list.

One interesting insights that came about as people responded to the article
came from BigToe, who said:

Pertaining to Hoax #1:

All names on AOL must have at least 3 characters and a maximum of ten.
This helps eliminate fakers.

Just thought you'd like to know.

DIGEST Q
Tanstaafl replies to some wquestions in the Jan 31 HH Digest:
>then change your OUTGOING mail server to one where you want the email to
>be bounced from. For this you will need to do a little exploring. I
>tried a few [mail servers] before I got a header that told nothing
>except my fake email address, so send yourself some test messages and
>look at the FULL headers (in navigator goto View, Headers All ).

The problem with this is that the server will show the server
from which you bounced your mail, as it does in my headers. You need
to do some cutting before you bounce your mail.
What I do to circumvent the problem is to bounce my mail via a
NNTP server, I know this isn't ethical, but neither is fake mail. Most
NNTP servers allow this, but only with some persuasion.

>Lots of servers I got "do not relay" messages from and some showed where I
>dialed in from (aaarrghhh).

One way to remove the problem with "do not relay" messages is
to change the e-mail address to which you send you mail. I don't send
my mail to user@node.server.com, but I send it to
user%node.real-server.com@node.relaying-server.com. The SMTP server at
node.relaying-server.com strips the @node.relaying-server.com and
changes the user%node.real-server.com to user@node.real-server.com.
Almost all NNTP/SMTP servers will allow this. The only problem
is when you try to post to:
user%node.real-server.com%node.second-relaying-server.com@node.first-relayin
g-server.com
the server at node.second-relaying-server.com can tell that it's been
relayed once and will post it back to node.first-relaying-server.com
with a "do not relay" message, but often the servers have been set up
so badly that this isn't a problem. It does give for lots of rubbish
being send with your message if you add too many servers.

************
Here's an anonymous TELNET question --

Subject: HH-problems with the port 25 thing

Okay here's my problem. I telnet to port 25 and then try to send myself
e-mail, just to see if it works. It says everything worked okay, but I
never get the message. I've tried with a couple of different servers
and a couple of different e-mail accounts as the rcpt to:

Here's a log, can anyone tell me what's wrong?
I never get the msg.

220 mercury.any.edu Mercury 1.32 ESMTP server ready.
helo santa@north.pole.net
250 mercury.any.edu Hi there, santa@north.pole.net.
mail from:santa@north.pole.net
250 Sender OK - send RCPTs.
rcpt to:me@myemail.com
250 Recipient OK - send RCPT or DATA.
data
354 OK, send data, end with CRLF.CRLF
does this work?
.
250 Data received OK.
quit
221 mercury.any.edu Service closing channel.

So can anyone tell me what's wrong? I've waited a couple of days since
I first tried this and still nothing has come through.

I would first convince them to upgrade to NT 4.0, service pack 3, IIS4.0. 
Exchange Server 5.0 for NT is a fairly good MTA. Keep up on all the
patches, etc. Consider joining NTBugtraq (mailing list) to discuss NT
bugs, etc.

This is definitely not the cheap way out. It will cost the company some
dollars to do the NT 4.0 upgrade, and to purchase Exchange Server, but you
are looking at securing your site. IIS4.0 comes with Exchange Server, I
beleive. You could also try to talk them into purchasing the Backoffice
Suite for Small Business, which comes with NT Server, Exchange Server,
IIS4.0, SQL, SMS, etc... It may even come with NT Workstation.. but not
too sure about that.

Good Luck!

CAN SOMEONE SNED ME THE TRANSLATION TO THIS, PLEASE? - RJ

Halloooooo,
Leeft gij nog?Lang geleden da ik nog iets gehoord heb van u.
De dropping zou waarschijnlijk doorgaan maar Johan zal waarschijnlijk niet
kunnen meegaan.Zoudt gij dan eventueel willen helpen?

Stainless_Steel Rat follows up on the Firewall question with

In addition, you should realize that all major market firewalls log 
just about everything about a connection going through them, (like the 
URLs you're been surfing, your failed FTP attempts, etc.) The only 
reason you haven't been busted is because most firewalls log so much 
crap that admins get tired of reading them on a regular basis. Why try 
to a firewall? Just go around it. Don't bother trying to crack a FW, 
if a target has a FW look for dial-ins, modem banks, RAS servers, PC 
anywhere connections, Lotus Notes Servers, extra internet connections, 
routers connecting third party WANs, etc). If you want to FTP go get a 
modem and slap it into you analog line at your office and use you 
private ISP to dial in and surfs up. But be careful, if you get caught 
you'll definitely get fired.

RJ -> SnadBoy has a program called "REVELATION" which will display the
contents of this file when the asterisks are on the screen. You should be
able to do a search and locate a downlaod site near you. If not, drop me a
line and I'll forward the program to you.
