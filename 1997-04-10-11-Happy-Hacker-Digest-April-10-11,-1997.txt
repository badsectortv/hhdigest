Mail Me to Join We Will update Results every week through Mail

Now this will Be like a Hacker Internet which will make hacking on 
these servers legal We will have competition

-  6 or less hackers per team. 
-  Each team has 1 or more system. 
-  The system must run Linux/BSD/SunOS, and be up at least between 3pm 
till 11:30 pm. -  The game is played for on week then expires if no 
one one

-  On systems owned by the team, each user may have one 
   account, with any systems privileges.

-  Each team has 1 account on each enemy system

  - 2.5mb quota per account

  - must be a normal user

-must be a  file saying "you got  me" inside the 
file must be called victory.yes

-victory.yes can be chomoded to any user even root 
but the uid or gid must exist

-victory.yes can be in any dir

-any find utility must must be only allowed 
by root

-to win u must change the motd to say the this

"takeover by <your team name>

the victory.yes location is <the location here>"

then you must  contact a judge to see the MOTD 
 

-victory.yes location has to be submitted to a judge before you 
begin. You must let the judge login to make sure its there. 
the judge must have a login so he can frequently check 
and make sure victory.yes is still there and to see if anyone won.

 - super users on opposing teams are NOT allowed to 
intervene with other hackers, this includes killing, 
writing to their terminals, or disturbing them in 
any way shape or form, however, super users are 
allowed to use snoop and other programs to monitor 
opposing team members, but they cannot DIRECTLY 
 step in and kill the user. super users CANNOT delete 
 files created by the opposing team members. 
 

if you shut a system down             :  100 points 
if your system gets shut down         :  -50 points 
 

On Sunday midnight, all points are worked out, and 
the league positions are calculated. 
============================================== 
Users will be kicked  from hacknet and team will loose 50 points for:

1.denial of service attacks 
2.removing system files 
3.rebooting a machine 
4.e mail bombing 
5.Killing Opponent's Connection at any time. 
6.Echoing to opponent's tty and distracting or screwing up the 
opponent 7.Moving Victory.yes 8.Killing judges 9.Echoing to judges tty 
and distracting or screwing up the judge. 
============================================== U MAY NOT INTERACT WITH 
OPPONENTS ON A SYSTEM IN ANY WAY!!!! EXCEPT FOR SPYING!!!

Carolyn: Warpy, I consider it a badge of honor that a group of people 
who hide behind their hacker handles flame me. Especially when in 
flaming me they are making truly egregious technical errors! So I 
don't feel much need to "redeem" myself.

Latest thing is that jericho is claiming in his dc-stuff flames that 
keyboards are not ports! Sheesh. The *only* thing a keyboard does is 
create an input interface with the user. If that isn't a port, I'm a 
baked potato. Hmmm, I wonder, will this incite yet another flame war 
over my definition of a keyboard as an "interface"?;^) At least he did 
admit that I was right that you can hack some kinds of printers.

For those of you who were on when some d00dz were flaming me on 
Infowar IRC for saying Robert Morris Sr. invented hacking -- here's 
the straight stuff. Guess who invented the game Core War (in the 60s, 
no less)? It was Morris. Guess what he must have been doing that 
inspired him to figure out a legal way to do it instead:)

Note on flame policy: I only will respond to correct extreme technical 
errors! Don't believe more than 10% of what you read on the dc-stuff 
list. The OK to believe rate on this HH list, however, probably isn't 
over 50%, so don't take what we say here as gospel truth either:) 
Again, remember, we have designated the dc-stuff list to carry HH 
flame wars. Email majordomo@dis.org with message "subscribe dc-stuff".

You can get all this information for free by downloading the Windows

help file and provides an incredible amount of information regarding 
Win95, including the registry. I've seen better, but this one is free.

From: hedrek@wantree.com.au

I do tracert on a remote computer. It works and gives me the hops and 
details etc., including the IP No. of the remote computer I am looking 
at. I go to whois.internic.net and enter the IP No. of that remote 
computer. I get the following message: No match found for ..........(

Carolyn: There are several possibilities. Your best bet is to use 
either the commands dig or nslookup instead. You can find those 
commands on most Unix boxes. For details see GTMHH Vol.3 #2, "Mapping

 *** Cracking 
=============================================================

From: "NK" <nk@xtasy.prestel.co.uk>

More on the old old phf exploit - Theoretically one should be able to 
execute a shell using phf , and if very lucky the web daemon will be 
owned by root so a root shell might be obtained. I decided to try this 
out a while back - however for a shell to operate , a silly web 
browser obviously isn't the solution.

I went to http://target.server/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/sh%20/ with 
a web browser to check (I already knew that this server isn't checking 
for phf use). And got no error.

Next I telnetted to port 80 of the target.server and first sent a few 
random chars to see if I got an error and that it was working OK. Next 
time I telnetted I used the command GET 
/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/sh%20/ Nothing happened. However after 
checking all the open connections I found that there was still a 
connection to the target.server open. Normally the connection would be 
closed after an error , or after the operation completes.

Am I to assume that a shell was actually started on the targer.server 
, if so how would I access it. The telnet session stays open but 
nothing happens.

Cheers.

Carolyn: Thank you for fubaring the URL of your target. Your post is 
as borderline as I ever want to run on this list. Unless you have 
permission to hack, you need to back off NOW. Honest, guys, it isn't 
that hard to get permission to hack somewhere. How about trying that 
Corewars competition instead?

It's probably because the web server is run as a user with low 
privileges, such as nobody. Nobody doesn't have the rights to access 
files readable only to superusers, such as /etc/shadow, nor should he 
have writing privileges or a homec directory.

Rm would probably work if you have high enough privileges. It all 
depends on your privileges.

Try to get some info in their HINFO records, by looking at their DNS 
records. That could tell the system type. Port 23 is telnet, so the 
prompt should also tell you the system type. Also, some things like 
Sendmail (25) might tell you the system type.

 *** Port 25 Stuph 
===============================================================

From: "Michael Paul" <mbp@locke.ccil.org>

I think someone asked this a while ago, but Carolyn misunderstood the 
question.  When I send mail from a program such as Eudora, the header 
contains a sender's name and address, subject, and a from: line.  When 
I telnet to port 25 and send mail, the header contains a sender's 
e-mail address but NO name, NO subject, and an APPARENTLY-from: line. 
What does Eudora do differently?  Does anyone know of a program to log 
data transferred, so I can find out what it's sending to the server?

Also, the header contains a line called X-TCP-IDENTITY that contains 
my username on my ISP.  Is there a way to change this?

Carolyn: When forging email, after the "data" command, you can insert 
that name, subject and any other headers by typing in like this:

subject: Whee, I'm forging email! 
favorite-color: polka dot 
X-comment: go soak your head 
Received: from ender (slip2.worldaxes.com [206.20.145.2]) by 
locke.ccil.org (8.8.5/8.7.3) with ESMTP id RAA16791 for

Message-Id: <199704092146.RAA16791@locke.ccil.org>

The basic trick is to either use only one word or else link words with 
hyphens, followed by a colon, for each entry in your forged header.

As for X-TCP-IDENTITY, I don't know of any way to change it without 
having root. Anyone have ideas?

Before you get worried about me wanted some major secret Hacking info. 
Let me explain.  I am a network engineer who hacks to 1)learn a ton 
about the systems I work with and 2) find potential problems in my 
systems and my customer's systems.  I have a question.  What are the 
potential methods someone would use to hack port 25.  Is there any 
escape character that will drop them out of s-mail and into a shell. 
Or is it a more involved process?

Carolyn: It's more involved. It depends on what program is running on 
25. While new flaws in sendmail are found with alarming frequency, I 
have heard that smail and qmail are secure (as of today). Does anyone 
on the list know of exploits for them?

I never tried to imply that social engineering was easy or that it can 
be done by reading my FAQ. It requires a talent for people, pure and 
simple. Those talents CAN be improved by practice and learning trends 
in the way people operate. That's why I always suggest the book, 
"Interpersonal Communication" by Joseph Devitto. It just lists the 
trends in the way people speak and says, in no clear terms, how to 
manipulate them. Any hacker who tries to social engineer the actual 
sysadmin is a moron anyhow. It really cannot be done. If it can be 
done, fire the sysadmin. You social engineer the little people (users) 
and then use exploits and real hacking to get root or whatever it is 
you're trying to grab. It is a skill to be used with hacking, not 
instead of it. I suggest people read the stuff that is written about 
it simply as an intro. It is not meant to be a guide. the only guides 
are psychology books and practice.

Social Engineering:

  I love this word -- I'm 30 now and never was a particularly good 
  hacker.  But I could charm the passwords off any old ditty that 
  haplessly answered the phone.  I never spoke to the managers -- what 
  I found useful was to find companies that used a lot of 'temp 
  service' employees -- the end result, after talking to clueless 
  newbies of the temp kind, was enough passwords/ID's that enabled 
  'us' (hint) to figure out the best way to have access.

The previous posts said knowing something about psychology, and that 
is good, but I think a better aptitude would be SALES!  Yes, that and 
a little acting skill.  We always had a dopey friend that was bigger 
than all of us and had a deep voice that the old ladies trusted.

You aren't going to social engineer anything if you're constantly 
behind the screen.  If anything, with the people that I deal/hire on a 
professional level, social interaction is just as important as 
computer skill.

Try doing it from a pay phone, i.e., a service rep. in the field.  Oh, 
and don't screw up anything, case in point being whenever I need to 
learn about new software, I call the very same business we hacked 12 
years ago.  It's not that way because we vandalized anything.

Great list, and kudos from Tokyo!

I would disagree here. Most of the SEing I have done in the past were 
completely anonymous to some degree or another. Sure I say I am "Bill 
in network support" or whatever, but I never give up anything that 
would compromise my identity. I would consider that fairly anonymous. 
If you are doing the SEing in person though, you are dead on. You have 
to resign to the fact that you will be seen, may have to fork over 
some kind of ID, or whatever else.

Lay off the crack Carolyn. Social Engineering is roughly defined as 
obtaining information from someone by tricking them into thinking you 
are someone else.

So you think. I am not the "best" by any means, but I rarely fail when 
I set my mind to it, and I never tell them my real name.

>But trust me, it is easier to get information by being honest than

It is obvious you have never had to try to social engineer any real 
information out of someone then. If you call up and say "Hey, this is 
Jason and I am just some random citizen, can I please have your switch 
dialin?", you will get laughed at. Any serious or proprietary 
information will not be handed out THAT easy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Carolyn: Funny thing, I have found that if I really, really want to 
play with someone else's computer, all I have to do is ask politely 
and honestly and they will let me on it. In fact, people will even 
give me permission to try to crack into root! That's the best social 
engineering of all. Of course I go to some effort to make friends with 
them first. It takes more time, but it's legal and no one gets hurt.

The first account that Keith and I honestly social engineered (I was 
not always perfect like I am now:):) was by putting our home up as 
collateral for the purchase of a PDP 11/23. The owner, John Kaur, 
responded by letting us keep a terminal in our home -- with 150 baud 
modem -- on which the whole family played Adventure, Zork and Star 
Trek. It cost us no money, slight risk, and kept us in computers for 
much of the 70s, back when computers were rare and expensive. OK, we 
got our own, an Intel microprocessor programmer, in 1975, but Kaur's 
box had all the games:)

The problem of the dishonest social engineer is you start out thinking 
that to get information you have to trick someone. The easiest way to 
get information, however, is to be totally honest. How do you suppose 
I have managed to make a living at gathering information? Lying only 
gets you so far.

Besides, it's hard to keep your stories straight when you are lying. 
Can you believe this, I actually know a guy who told me his *only* 
communications with johnny xchaotic -- the nationally infamous email 
bomber/spammer -- were jx's unsolicited calls from a cloned cell 
phone. Then later this guy told me his *only* contacts with jx were 
via email. Tsk, tsk.

 *** Linux Woes 
=================================================================

X-Sender: wbdhruss@pop.netspace.net.au

I recently installed Linux (Slackware 3.1). I was all geared up for it 
to be a very difficult task, but it was actually not too difficult to 
get everything up and running (after digging up all the docs that came 
with my PC). Anyway, I used umsdos.  I do not recommend it. True, you 
do not have to repartition, but it has caused me problems. I get 
reports of lost clusters (from Norton Disk Doctor) frequently, they 
have not contained anything important as of yet, and I do not like 
taking too many chances :P  another reason I do not recommend using 
umsdos is linux takes up a lot more space than it would if it were in 
its own partition... I think this has something to do with all the 
tiny files associated with a linux system and the FAT on an msdos 
partition... to just give linux a try, umsdos is fine, but it does not 
seem to be a good 'way around' repartitioning or getting another HD :) 
BTW, if anyone knows why I get the lost clusters, I would much 
appreciate it if they would post an answer. one more thing... anyone 
out there live in Gippsland?

 *** Shell Account Stuph 
==============================================================

From: Warpy <warpy@null.net>

On whenever some dude said this...

>Question2, 
>when I use uname, it says SunOS, but when I telnet to localhost, it 
>is SystemV. What is this?

The answer to that guys question is very simple. Versions of SunOS 
above 4.1.3 are System V Release 4 (SVR4 for short). If he were to do 
a uname -a he would find out what version of SunOS is running, and he 
would see that it is one higher than 4.1.3.

Versions up to 4.1.3 are Berkeley Standard Derivative (BSD) and for 
some spack reason Sun decided to hop onto the SVR4 wagon after that..

If he came up with something like SunOS 5.5.x, that means that the 
system is running Solaris 5.5.x (which is what Sun prefers to call 
sunos's 4.1.4 upwards). He might also like to know that a Solaris 
buffer overflow came out a while back. If he were to do sum searching 
around in back issues of BUGTRAQ, or any of the other security mailing 
lists he might find it.

 *** Port 19 Woes 
==================================================================

From: neMEsis <nemesis@minot.com>

I was wondering what I had to change to keep from getting msgs when 
people use the write command or the msg command. I also wondered if 
there was a way to close out peoples access to the sh >/dev/ttyp 
command without keeping me from using it.  One of my friends learned 
of this trick and has been telnetting me to port 19 on our server 
(which they say they have no reason to close even when I pointed out 
the simple denial of service attacks that can be made from them). This

 *** Guilty of Using Jargon 
==============================================================

From: crash31@juno.com (Shun Chit [John] Sik)

 I just want to begin by saying that I really like Happy Hacker 
but since I an a newbie, I don't understand some of the terms that I 
have come across. Like spammers, cookie killer and IRC. I guess that 
is it for now. Can you please explain this to me please. Thanks. 
Crash.

Carolyn: Oops, sorry for using so much jargon.

1) A spammer is someone who sends out lots of unsolicited email or 
Usenet posts. A spammer could send thousands of posts to one news 
group, or one post each to thousands of news groups. A spammer might 
send one email each to thousands or millions of email addresses, or 
might send thousands or even millions of emails to one email address. 
The most infamous Usenet spammers is the Phoenix AZ law firm of Canter 
and Siegal. The most infamous email spammer who sends only a few 
emails each to millions of people is Cyberpromo. The most infamous 
email bomber -- a guy who sends zillions of emails to each of the many 
people he likes to bomb -- is johnny xchaotic. What every spammer has 
in common is that they have to find ways to forge email. This is 
because most people hate spammers, so spammers are always hiding.

2) "Cookie killer" refers to keeping out the stuff that Web sites put 
on your disk when you visit them. The people who put up Web sites 
oftentimes like to store information on your disk about what you were 
doing when you visited them. Then the next time you surf in, they read 
what's on your cookies file and put more stuff there. They generally 
do this to collect market research information on you. Since lots of 
us think it is none of their darn business and resent them putting 
stuff on our disks, we keep them from doing this.

3) IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. It's a wonderful way to waste 
time, make friends, and conduct flame wars.
