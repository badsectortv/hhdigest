PLEASE NOTE: I apologise if you recieve multiple transmissions of this
Digest. Due to some problems with our ISP, the initial "send" of the Digest
failed, and several thousand digests did not go out. So, for some of you,
this will be the third copy you recieve, for others the second; but
(hopefully)everyone will at least get this one. Sorry for any
inconvenience. If this really upsets you, send a flame message to IP
address 127.0.0.1\\dev\nul. If that doesn't satisfy you, contact Shepherd's

*** Hacker War Game Rules
===================================================================
We hope to get a hacker war game going with an SGI Indigo (Irix operating
system) on a T1 soon. But before we open up for your gaming phun, we need to
agree on some ground rules. Here are my suggestions. Please let me know what
you thing the rules should be.

1) We would start with a known insecure system that can easily be broken
into from the outside. We would reload the original operating system every
day (in the process deleting root kits, Trojans etc.) for the first month of
the game so newbies could have the fun of breaking in.

2) No credit for denial of service attacks.

3) After first month we would get serious. We would stop reloading the
insecure operating system and stop removing executables loaded by the
players. Anyone who gets root would be permitted to secure the system so
others can't break in.

4) We would, however, require that the Indigo be left running services and
software comparable to what a commercial Internet Service Provider would
offer. The services should include at least a Web server, ftp server, email,
secure shell and secure sockets layer telnet. It would have to include
full-service user accounts (not some wimpy Pine shell) and allow use of
Pagemaker (which has an exploit in the configuration we have installed, but
it's OK to patch the bug) and other software to be determined. We will also
require that remote syslog remain enabled and no editing of the log files.

5) Anyone who gets root wins a free shell account.

6) Whoever is root should not delete any user accounts.

7) We would help cover the cost of the T1 by selling shell accounts on this
computer for $10 per month. If you can figure out how to use your shell
account to get root (it is easier than breaking in from the outside), then
your account becomes free.

8) If we get evidence that you are using your account to commit computer
crime, we will kick you off the system. (We especially need input on this
because of the potential for a player to cheat by making it appear that
another player is committing computer crime from our game box.)

9) All logins must be through secure sockets layer or secure shell.

10) We would pipe the syslog file to both a Web site and an ftp server so
anyone may evaluate the techniques being used to both break into and secure
the system.

11) We will allow whoever is root to post his or her boasts to a Web site on
the Indigo. Root should leave previous boasts on the Web server.

12) How would we enforce these rules? We have the boot disk!;^)

Nah.. Whatever you write, I wouldnt tell you there is much difference from
Crackers and Hackers. Until you know in details how the system work, you
wouldn't be able to get into it. The matter is only, do you want to do it or
not.. sometimes you need this anyway......
And that's not good to call cops anyway..

If someone has written a large, capable program, that has met a
widespread need, then why do they give it away? Anyone willing to work
for free seems to be implying that their work, and their time, is worth
the price they're asking for.

Sounds like a statement a "cracker" would make : that they would want
something for free. Are you willing to give your work away for free? Why
not?

From: ~-_-~Un4Scene~-_-~

As I have just finished reading the latest HH Digest I find myself
feeling VERY insulted. I am wondering what has happened to the Guide To
Mostly Harmless Hacking. I haven't missed an issue of it in at least
two years but now I'm going to cancel my subscription to it. I remember
when you moderated it ... anyone could send in any questions they may
have concerning computer security, virii, encryption, cracking, etc...
and could expect to get an excellent answer if their message was
posted. Now the impression I get from the latest "issue" is that all
those people who were asking questions about computer security, and make
it a habit to routinely try to break it are no longer welcome. The
impression I received from this latest "issue" was that any one who does
not know a dozen different programming languages and know at least three
spoken languages should bow down before the new moderators of the HH
Digest and kiss their "Demigod" asses. And also anybody that follows
the darker side of the computer underground should not be allowed to
call themselves a hacker, as it is an insult and a blemish on the name
of the so called "Demigods" of "hacking." Whoever this stuck-up,
over-the-hill, egotistic, asshole is (please excuse my language) I think
he just insulted half the english-reading worlds HACKERS, and yes, I
mean people who break, or attempt to break, computer security. I'm sure
I am not alone in wishing that the HH Digest could return to what it
was. If I didn't know better I would say that the entire GTMHH family
has sold out. Incidentally, I consider myself a hacker, and will
continue to relate myself, as well as any others who share my interests
in computer security, by that name. As a hacker I have made a decent
living for myself in the system administration field, quite successfully
I might add considering I have also been able to fund the opening of my
own car/truck racing shop.
I also know C, C++, VB, Perl, HTML, Java, MSQL, Delphi, and am
starting to learn Oracle (just for the fun of it). I am very fluent in
UNIX, BSD, Linux, Win 95/NT, DOS, MS-DOS, Macintosh, (original) Apple,
etc... I'm also familiar with all the major protocols (i.e.: TCP/IP,
SMTP, etc...). All this in addition to being an OK street/strip race
mechanic?? You bet!! And I'm completely self taught!!! I didn't even
finish high school!!! But are you ready for the real kicker??? I'm
only 20 years old.

***BIG F***IN' DEAL***

So maybe I know a little more than most, you still wont ever find me
running around calling myself a demigod, and pronouncing my own laws and
standards to force upon others. I still attend my monthly 2600
meeting. I still answer peoples questions on USENET. I still
occasionally used AOL till about a month ago!! My point is that those
with the excess knowledge should be trying to teach others who are
willing to learn. I have always thought that to be a central theme
throughout the hacking community, and that was the main reason that I
always liked the HH Digest. It was very helpful to me when I first
became interested in computer security, and I have no doubt it was very
helpful to others with similar hobbies. SO WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED???? 
I haven't seen so much as a foot note concerning any bugs or flaws in
any systems in the last few issues. Not a single post from anybody,
anywhere. All your loyal readers get is introductions to new moderators
and supremely egotistic ass-holes who apparently have nothing better to
do than to try to shit on the little people.
So now I come to the end of this letter and to my main point. Ms.
Meinel, the HH Digest was a great and wonderful thing when you were
moderating it. I've always been under the impression that you are the
founder of the HH Digest, if this is true, then PLEASE, I beg you, bring
it back to what it was six months ago, or a year ago. Make the digest
live up to its name. If you are so intent on this new guy running a
mailing list that let him run his own. Their are thousands of readers
out there that are begging to be filled with the knowledge that you're
digest used to provide. Don't let them down.

~-_-~Un4Scene~-_-~

[Carolyn -- Sorry you are disappointed. I'm putting a little more time into
this list now. Help! We need people who will help out by writing good stuff
for the Digest -- and we're sorry so many good posts have disappeared. It
wasn't that many people's posts weren't good. With the complications of
trying to have several moderators. Please remember we are all volunteers

Also, I have a Guide coming up about a fellow -- Fatal Error -- who has been
more your kind of hacker, and is mostly self-taught, yet has risen to be
senior network engineer at AGIS (Internet backbone).

In the meantime, in defense of Eric S. Raymond, other people are the ones
who call him, Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall and others demigods. In defense of
the rest of us, please understand that all us hackers are arrogant. Heck,
I'll bet I'm more arrogant than Raymond is! It's kind of like a disease that
we try to handle by poking fun at ourselves. You guys are welcome to poke
fun at us, too, to keep our arrogance within bounds.]

You should mention that very few Unix vendors put PICO on a default
install. Linux and FreeBSD do, but Sun, HPUX, AIX, and other commercial
Unix variants do not.

No, it doesn't. On a SunOS box with BASH, it outputs a little differently.

I am a programmer and one heck of a hacker!
Today I am going to
forge email from Santa Claus.

(Notice the line break? If you do a little creative playing, I am sure you
can get it to output on one line though.)

If chmod 700 doesn't work on your system, fix chmod. Octel notation is
much more efficient.

Take your own advice and 'man ln' and read about ln's behaviour. You
should also mention that on several Unix boxes, a symbolic link is not
owned by you if you link to a file owned by another user.

On a Sun 4.1.4 box, here is the entry for the link:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root 9 Oct 1 19:42 .rhosts ->/dev/null

And lets look at the file we are linking to:
crw-rw-rw- 1 root 3, 2 Jan 5 23:22 /dev/null

Notice the file ownership?

Now, lets look at another example:

lrwxrwxrwx 1 jericho 5 Jan 5 23:59 link1 ->test1
-rw------- 1 jericho 0 Jan 5 23:58 test1

What happens when we "echo hi &gt>link1" and then "cat test1"?

-rw------- 1 jericho 3 Jan 6 00:01 test1

Notice the file size? Jumped from 0 to 3.. because test1 has the word 'hi'
in it. Not exactly as you describe above.

>	Here's how you can make your bash history disappear. Simply give the
>command "ln -s /dev/null ~/.bash_history."

And that won't do anything for your bash history. Notice the extra "." at
the end of your example?

[Carolyn: News flash. In the English language we are required to put a
period at the end of every sentence. I forgot that some people don't know this.]

>supposed bash history file of mine, the stuff you type in during a "talk"
>session does not appear in the .bash_history file. The guy who faked it
>didn't know this! Either that, or he did know, and put that in to trick the

Or it was redirected into the file. Your bash history is a plain text
file, and can be overwritten, appended to, etc.

[Carolyn: Or someone could just as easily write a file and say, "honest,
jericho, this is really Carolyn's bash history! And I live on a planet near
Beta Lyrae!]

>people who would read it and flame me into revealing their ignorance.

Enough people who doubted the file were pointed to the site it came from.
They saw proof that the site was indeed hacked, proving that your shell
history could have been reached very easily. I doubted it until that person
pointed the same out to me.

[Carolyn: Yeah, a secret site that was really truly hacked. If you are so
sure this is for real, how come you are afraid to tell anyone what this
super haxored site was? And how many assassins were on the grassy knoll? And
how many times have you seen Elvis in 1997?]

>The guys who got caught by this trick tried to get out of their embarrassing
>spot by claiming that a buffer overflow could make the contents of a talk

At no point did anyone claim a buffer overflow was responsible. Several
people mentioned that something could have been stored in a buffer (like
the clipboard of your windows box), and then pasted into that file very
easily.

[Carolyn: Yeah, right, I spend time pasting unlikely things into my
nonexistent bash history file just to give you something to flame. You are
lucking that file was fake, or you would have been committing a Federal
felony passing it around. Admit it, the guy who gave it to you snookered
you:):)]

Insulting people that are able to hack into your accounts (and thus have
more knowledge of security than you or your admins), while making such
blatant mistakes above..

[Carolyn: jericho, that is the most common error of the kode kiddie. They
think that if they can break in, they know more than the sysadmin of the
system. Rather than argue myself blue in the face trying to educate you, I
am about to run a little experiment, an SGI Indigo running Irix in a hacker
war game. Who will be able to break in? Who will then be able to secure the
box after they get in to keep others out? Will you be able to become root?
Once you are root, will you be able to keep me out?]

According to some, you don't even have an alias to do that upon login. So
watch who you call kode kiddie. Most Unix users I know set aliases in
their .login or .profile like the following:

alias ls="ls -alF"

If your umask is 700 as you mention above, it should run just fine. If you
set the umask so it isn't executable by default, then the above would be
expected.

Or learn the syntax for 'find', which comes with most Unix variants, if
not all of them.

find / -name netstat -print

That should search the entire filesystem, looking in every directory you
have permission to go in, and report back what it finds.

Many utils will require the ability to open raw sockets (like ping or
traceroute), and will not operate correctly if you compile it yourself.

Since you are fond of using BASH, and mention it above, you should also
mention that editing .login will do nothing if BASH is your default shell.

That's funny, I've known some very intelligent "hackers" who have broken
in to computers and unfortunately use the word f*** all too often.

As noted later in jericho's comments ending all of these commands in a
period does not in any way help the newbies which you are obviously trying
to cater this paper towards. Also, you might try to learn some of the
advantages of a more powerful UNIX editor such as vi (my personal 
favorite) or emacs since you seem to be an "elite" hacker using a very
basic editor.

[Carolyn: In the English language a sentence must be ended with a period. If
any of you newbies have been confused by this and have been trying to put
periods on the end of your commands, please tell me and I will figure out a
way to write that is easier for you to understand.]

[..snip..]

You might also want to read up on bash a little bit more. The environment
variable "HISTFILE" can be set to null so that no history file is recorded.
This works in at least all recent versions of the bash shell.

/* flame bait personal attack */
You earlier insulted people for the use of profanity and now you use the
word "haxor"? Please, spare me..

ISP, with Kerberos and no rhosts stuff for the internal LAN. But that's just
my opinion.]

*** Best Intel Unix?
===================================================================
From: adam wellington (by way of Editor - Happy

I just recently subscribed to the Happy Hacker Digest and the Beginners 
Guide to Mostly Harmless Hacking and I can truthfully say that I have 
learned more from reading it than from any other hacking mailing list, 
page, or "How to." It's the perfect thing for people like me who have 
never downloaded any pre made hacking programs while watching his 
friends download things like "WinNuke" and other programs made to cause 
people trouble, I'd rather be challenged.

That being said, on to my question.

I'm getting a few parts from upgrades I have scheduled for other people. 
I plan to make a UNIX box out of them. My question is, what type of 
Unix do the other readers of the digest prefer, also what kind of cool 
apps and utils are there? I'm doing it to learn UNIX better than I 
already do (I have some experience using it but not installing and 
administrating it). Thanks in advance.

*** Another Place to Find Tattletale Browser Files
===================================================================
From: Cool724678 (by way of Editor - Happy Hacker List)
Subject: SOMETHING I HAVE NOTICED IN THE TEMP FILES

I just finished reading your article "How to hack into windows 95 pc's" and
I think you left out something. When kids hack into the Netscape parental
control or Internet explorer there's a record it keeps besides the cookies
and the netscape.ini lines there's something else. What about those little
files that go to C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\, while you're surfing on the web some
files including graphics, html's and http addresses save files in that
directory so when you go back to that specific site it will load a little
quicker. If those files are not erased the parent or boss could find out
where you've been.

My question is, Is it safe to erase all those files?

[Carolyn: Thanks for the info. My browsers don't normally leave anything in
/windows/temp after closing. But perhaps if the computer crashes or if the
power goes out while using a browser, that might leave tattletale files in
temp.

Because my computer crashes and loses power from time to time, every few
months I clean out /windows/temp by deleting EVERYTHING. It hasn't hurt
anything yet. Of course, I close all programs that use /temp before deleting
things.]
