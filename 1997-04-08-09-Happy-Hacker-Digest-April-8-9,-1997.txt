From: ae630@pgfn.bc.ca (Tim Gutteridge)

 I just found a great WWW site. It's at 
http://kryten.eng.monash.edu.au/gspam.html. It's a page on spammers and 
how to decipher headers to get them. It includes a whole bunch of tools 
that you can use over the WWW, like traceroute, whois, and DIG. Time to 
dig out How to Map the Internet Again...

I have tried this program "Spam Hater" and it works great.  I don't 
really know if it will trace everything but from my tests it works 
great.  It is definitely worth the download and it is also easy to use. 
It picks up on the "U* ***** 3.0" program that seems to be the most 
popular spammer program.

Thank you for your time and please keep up the great work, it has helped

 *** Social Engineering 
====================================================================== 
From: "Stainless Steel Rat" <s_s_rat@hotmail.com>

I have some comments on social engineering.

It seems that a lot of misconceptions about social engineering. It sound as 
if people want to believe that social engineering can be learned like a new 
programming language or by simply reading some kind of "Beginners Guide to 
Social Engineering".  Well, this couldn't be further from the truth.  I work 
in the business and have been on the receiving end of some seriously lame 
social engineering attempts.  Things like: "um, hi, um, this is the sysadmin 
and, um, the big boss wants you to, um, change some permissions on some 
files, OK?"  Sure thing sparky, I'll get right on it after I write down you 
number off the caller ID box, now get off your daddy's computer and leave me 
alone!  Social engineering and using a computer to get into a system are 
completely different ball games which require totally different skills. 
This is not to say that 
social engineering is particularly hard.  In fact, it's pretty easy to get a 
person to leak important information, provided the social engineer is good 
enough.  However, it is one of the very few aspects of hacking/phreaking 
where direct human contact and good social skills are needed in order to be 
successful.  You have to give up a little bit of that anonymity which 
Hackers/Phreakers/Crackers cherish so much.  On top of that, a lot of 
computer geeks I know have about as much social grace as a drunk monkey (no 
offense intended I'm a computer geek myself) much less enough savior faire 
to charm vital system security information out of somebody.  So unlike 
programming, social engineering takes a certain amount of innate *social* 
ability which can not be learned out of a book or off an IRC.  Well, maybe 
studying acting and psychology might help, but as far as picking it up out 
of a text doc, you can forget it.

Carolyn: I agree heartily with this post. As a matter of fact, I make much 
of my living from social engineering. This Happy Hacker list is social 
engineering, a technique to discover and publicize the knowledge floating 
around the hacker world.

Guess what: the best social engineers never lie. We use our real names. 
World-class social engineering is helping people to *want* to give you 
information. That's why when you join this email list I make my association 
with the Infowar site clear (we're the guys who fight computer crime) and 
tell you where else to learn about me (http://cmeinel.com, or read about 
me in the book Great Mambo Chicken by Ed Regis, Addison Wesley, 1990.)

The international organization for us guys who make a living on social 
engineering is the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals, 1700 
Diagonal Road, Suite 520, Alexandria VA 22314. But you can't be a member if 
you get caught telling lies or operating under a false name.

But trust me, it is easier to get information by being honest than through 
deceit. That's because it is really, really hard to lie in a convincing 
manner. Since lying is also a rotten thing to do, why not go around patting 
yourself on the back for being ethical while also making lots of money and 
having fun doing social engineering the right way?

 *** Domain Name Question 
======================================================================

From: hwsnyman@medic.up.ac.za (LiquidMetal)

Correct me if I'm wrong, but only American domains end with a .com 
South African domains would end with a .co.za 
Mmmmmmmmmm....Then how can "The Red Baron" claim to be a hacker from 
South-Africa and have a @hotmail.com thingy... 
(Unless he used a re-mailer....)

Later 
LiquidMetal

Carolyn: Hotmail is a Web-based email system. You surf into your account 
from anywhere in the world.

Also, there is no law that says that a domain name must reflect the nation 
of origin. For example, skyinet.net is an Asian ISP but uses the .net 
domain. The US domain is .us, but how many US domains end with .us?

Hi! I was reading some time ago in the HH Digest that there is a book 
called _Secrets of Windows 95_ that tells how to edit the registry. Well, 
I finally got some spare time and browsed around amazon.com, but came up 
empty. I'd really like to learn how to edit the registry. I live in a

It's easily done.  The newer releases of kernels (2.0.0+) have support 
precompiled in for the parallel port ZipDisk.  You'll either have to run 
LILO on your primary drive (don't know how your current bootloader will 
like that), or go the boot disk route.  Either way, use Linux's 'fdisk' 
utility to generate ext2 partitions on the Zip Disk and install away. 
This also works on JAZ drives, BTW.

Just treat it like any other hard drive.  If you try to do anything 
special, you'll just mess up.  When you boot your install disks, mount 
the ZipDisk just like you'd mount your regular hard drive (mount 
/dev/sda4 /mnt) and go to work.  Just remember that /dev/sd4 is where the 
kernel will put access to the Zip Drive, and you can't go wrong.

See?  You already know what to do!

Get the basic netpackage (I forget the archive name at present), pppd, 
and maybe tinyX if you've a mind to go graphical (and can get Netscape to 
work.  good luck).

I've never really dissected the exploit, but I'll take a shot at it...

/usr/local/bin/ph is the name of the SGI script you ran.

-m is a command-line switch, though I do not know what it does at present.

alias=c is another parameter, though I do not know what this means, either.

/bin/cat is the command to run the 'cat' command which will display a 
file to the standard output device (your screen).

/etc/passwd is the location of the password file, which you're passing to 
/bin/cat as a parameter.

>  What does this mean? On some systems with the bug present, the password

On the sites it works on, a flaw is utilised which lets a remote user 
look at any file on the system (which is what you did, with the password 
file as a specific target).  You could just as easily add a line to the 
password file 
(/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/echo%20"external::0:0::/root:/bin/sh) or 
something like that.  You could probably write a program line by line on 
the remote system, compile, and run it as well.

It looks like the program you were using didn't have privileges to read 
the file where the password strings are stored (which shoots down one of 
my theories..  oh well).

Don't know.  Why not use the exploit to create a file in the /tmp 
directory, see if it exists, and then erase it and see what happens?

It might just be a cosmetic difference.  You can change the login banner 
easily.  Or he might not be on a SunOS box to begin with.

If that's all you need to do to get to a shell, it sounds like you're 
logged into a shell, and then your ~/.login file contains a command to 
run the menu shell.  Just edit that file with pico or vi or something to 
remove it, and it should drop you into a shell by default.

Libraries work miracles.

Regarding people looking to find like-minded people to converse with in 
their area:

Buy an issue of 2600, and look for the meeting closest to where you 
live.  Stop by the first Friday of every month, and just start talking to 
people.  It's a great way to make friends even if they aren't heavily 
into the h/p scene.

 *** More IRC Wars 
============================================================

From: jsevilla@globe.com.ph (J. R. Sevilla)

Hi Happy Hackers,

I just had a bad experience in IRC.  Some guys at #teenmature of 
irc.qdeck.com just took over my newly created #apprentice where I was op.  I 
was just being friendly giving op to others but I think I was a bit too 
friendly.  I was really mad and sad (now I'm no happy hacker). 
I read about access levels and stuff but I can't quite understand how they 
work.  I also wanted to know how I can prevent someone from de-opping me 
even though I give him an op.  Please try to help me regarding this and 
please be very elaborate in giving me instructions (I'm just a newbie). 
Also, if you can help me avenge myself to those naughty, good-for-nothing 
guys, please tell me how.

Thanks very much Happy Hackers.

 *** Perl for Win 95 
===========================================================

Please make this anonymous.

There is a port of Perl version 5 for windows 95.  The best place to 
look for Perl ports or any other Perl stuff is the Perl Home Page 
(http://www.perl.com/perl).  If that doesn't have what you're looking 
for, try going to your favorite search engine and typing in "CPAN" 
(stands for Comprehensive Perl Archive Network).  Hope that helps!

Carolyn: Perl is a shell programming language. It is one of the two most 
valuable languages for hacking (C++ is the other).

 *** Carolyn Puts on Propeller Hat 
================================================================

Carolyn: In case any of you have been following the anti-Happy Hacker flame 
war on the dc-stuff email list, you may have been mislead on some technical 
topics. So it's time to put aside my jokes and put on the propeller hat.

1) Those guys are making a big deal about how I have supposedly been telling 
people to telnet into keyboards, monitors and printers. The issue is not 
whether you can telnet into them -- you can't, and I never told anyone they 
could. But in defense of newbies, I have not gotten even *one* report of a 
newbie trying to telnet into a monitor, printer or keyboard on account of my 
not having beaten this point into submission.

However, these guys are dead wrong when they claim only the numbered TCP/IP 
ports can be called ports. Monitors and keyboard are also ports! A port is 
defined as a anything that brings data (or "stuff" in the general sense) 
into or out of a black box -- which could be a computer. Now if you were to 
start calling your printer port the "printer thingie" on account of 
believing the claims of the dc-stuff flamers that it isn't a port, people 
will laugh their heads off at you.

Another confusing thing in this flame war is some comments that a printer 
cannot be used as a route to break into a computer. Wrongo! Today's printers 
are in themselves pretty sophisticated computers. And, guess what, there are 
many exploits which take advantage of not only printers but also device 
drivers, which are the programs that tell an operating system how to 
interact with devices such as, yes, a printer, monitor or keyboard.

According to some of the flames I have gotten, I must have led people who 
install Linux into thinking that when you install it, thousands of hardware 
thingies must have to be added to your computer to handle each and every of 
the kind of port that is a service, i.e. something you can telnet into. But 
I have not gotten one single post from a newbie saying he or she thought 
this. Guess what, newbies are not as dumb as those flamer d00ds think.

But just in case there are legions of dazed newbies out there trying to 
telnet into their monitors, here's the straight answer. If you give the 
command "telnet #" where # is any number that gets you a result, guess what, 
you are telnetting into a service. See the GTMHH "Port Surf's Up" for 
details on what these ports and their services are. But basically a service 
is a program which accepts your input and reacts to it in some way. If you 
can't find a port number assigned to a port you want to access, for example 
hda, that means it is a device driver, in this case a piece of software in 
Unix that tells your computer how to port data to and from a hard drive.

Also, there was mass confusion and derision on the dc-stuff list about my 
comments on the Infowar IRC channel about "black boxes." First, a quick 
question to those of you who have recently studied computer science. Do they 
teach you guys nowadays about finite state machine theory? To sum it up, an 
excellent way to model a control system -- for example, a computer -- is to 
model it as a series of black boxes connected by lines coming out of or into 
ports representing data flow and characterized by state transition 
functions. The reason for modeling things this way is that you can perfectly 
characterize the system without knowing anything about what is inside the 
black boxes. All you need to know is how many black boxes do you have, what 
are the ports, how are the boxes connected to each other, and what are the 
state transition functions.

In the case of the Internet, the services that we like to port surf make the 
host computers on the Internet behave like the black boxes of finite state 
machine theory. The software that we know as services are the state 
transition functions. IP addresses define the black boxes, and the TCP/IP 
protocol provides the I/O.

What this means is that when you telnet over to a strange computer you don't 
need to know what hardware it uses. You don't need to know its operating 
system, or any of the programs being run on it. All you need to know is its 
IP address and that -- to give a specific example --  when you give the 
command "telnet strange.computer.org 19" you are asking it to run a 
character generator (chargen) program. (You could also give the command 
"telnet strange.computer.org chargen" and get the same results.)If it is 
running chargen, then you get a string of ASCII characters in order that you 
can use to check for dropped packets between you and that computer. It's 
that easy.

2) There has been a bunch of profoundly clueless talk about encryption on 
the dc-stuff list, following up my April 2 appearance on IRC at Infowar. For 
starters, you don't have to decide whether you should take my word or 
someone else's word on this topic. You can read an excellent book on the 
mathematical underpinnings of encryption -- and of the topic in general of 
how do you tell whether it is possible to find an algorithm that can solve a 
problem whose answer can be summed up as either "yes" or "no" fast, or 
whether such a problem inherently is difficult to solve. The book is 
"Computers and Complexity." It's out of print, but your nearest university 
library can get it for you on Interlibrary Loan.

Now if you like to get seriously into math, here is a more detailed 
explanation of what I tried to get across to the encryption "experts" on IRC 
at Infowar on April 2. Szechuan Death had asserted that DES (data encryption 
standard) had been proven secure. But my response was that the only way one 
can "prove" that *any* encryption technique is secure is if and only if many 
unprovable assumptions hold true. As I mentioned on IRC, this even includes 
such basic assumptions as the laws of commutation and association. (For 
example, A*B is not equal to B*A if A and B are matrices!)

Most significantly, the classes of P and NP-Complete may not be distinct 
from each other. It is conceivable that someday someone may prove, for 
example, that NP-Complete is a subset of P. In that case the house of cards 
will collapse for public key encryption, and many other algorithms, too. But 
there is no possible way to prove that NP-Complete is not a subset of P. We 
can only say that problems within NP-Complete are all transformable to each 
other by algorithms whose upper bound on the computational steps required 
for the transformation is no more than a polynomial function of the size of 
the problem N.

The class P means the class of optimization problems whose answer is either 
yes or no that may be solved in a number of iterations that is a polynomial 
function of the number N of the elements of that problem. An example of the 
class P is the spanning tree problem, in which N might represent a number of 
cities and the spanning tree may be the highway system that may connect them 
all with the shortest distance of highway.

The class NP-Complete is short for nondeterministic polynomial time bound 
complete, which is the class of optimization problems whose answer is either 
yes or no that may be solved in a number of iterations whose upper bound is 
a polynomial function of the number N of elements of the problem if and only 
if the solver of the problem is supplied with a lucky guess 
(nondeterministic) on how to solve the problem (in the case of encryption 
the lucky guess is the decryption key). Otherwise, without the lucky guess 
or decryption key, the upper bound of the number of iterations required to 
solve the problem is an exponential function of the number of elements of 
the problem N. "Complete" refers to the fact that that any problem which can 
be shown to be transformable by a P type algorithm into any one problem 
within the set NP-Complete may also be transformed into any other element of 
this set by a P type algorithm. An example of an NP-Complete problem is 
traveling salesman, where the objective is to minimize travel distance 
through a set of cities without ever retracing one's path, ending at the 
city where one began.

Is your head spinning yet? What practical use is lots of math knowledge to a 
hacker? Have you ever seen the movie Sneakers? The plot line is a 
mathematician discovers a means to factor numbers using an algorithm that 
has an upper bound that is a polynomial function of the size N of the 
problem. This meant that RSA and PGP became worthless for encryption. All 
the car chases and crawling through attics and murders and stuff of the rest 
of the movie flowed from that premise.

So watch out for a cryptic news announcement someday having to do with 
factoring numbers. It could turn cyberspace upside down.
