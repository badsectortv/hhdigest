1. Welcome to the Happy Systems Administration Digest 
From: Jon <jammer@ecst.csuchico.edu>

Welcome to Linux.

This digest is a spin-off of the Happy Hacker Digest. Its topic is Linux. 
That's it. Linux. Running linux, installing linux, working with linux, 
whatever, it goes here.

This digest is NOT about hacking. While it may cover methods of securing a 
linux system, we will not discuss how to hack from/to a linux machine.

Currently, this digest will be sent out weekly, to all the recipients of the 
Happy Hacking Digest. In the future, we will move the HSAD to another list.

Happy Administration, 
-Jon

2. minilinux install?? 
From: "Kurt Pfister" <kpfister@ao.net>

I have installed minilinux (another version of linux which does not 
require 
a partition) on my win95 box.  Install went fine, however whenever I 
try to 
start linux the startup program tells me that there is not enough free 
memory between 90000h and 9ffffh and that there may be zombie programs 
running (zombie programs??).  It also tells me that I should check to 
see 
what drivers may be occupying this space. 
        When I check my system configuration I cannot see any drivers 
which may be 
using this space.  I then tried to reserve 90000h to 9ffffh but was 
told 
that I had entered at least one invalid value.  I don't know enough 
about 
hex to tell which value is invald.  Anyone have any ideas?  BTW this 
same 
thing happened when I tried to run monkeylinux. 
        Thanx

[Jon: This may be something in your ROM configuration. (Some systems 
      shadow ROM routines in RAM. ]

3. Accessing a UUCP server 
From: *Anonymous*

I need ur help on some stuph. I have an e-mail account with an 
*offlie* 
UUCP service. It runs LINUX and when I connect to it, it just 
transfrers my 
mail to my comouter and recceived the ones that I have to send I use 
Waffle 
and pegasus mail on my end. Now, how can I access the computer? Since 
there 
is no questions of Telnetting in?

[Jon: What would you want to access that for? There isn't much you 
      could do. If you want a shell account, try asking the ISP. ]

4. Monkey Linux 
From: Marius Mayerhoefer <ace_fth@hotmail.com>

Carolyn, 
        having read ALL (!) your articles I've finally decided to get 
        LINUX.....YO!! Now, you have provided much general info on 
Linux 
installing and stuff, but you haven't written anthing         about how to use 
it when you HAVE installed it !!! BTW what         about Monkey Linux ?? 
        I had planned to get Red Hat Linux but now I'm not so sure... 
        it seems Monkey got all stuff I need for hacking....until now 
        I have used several wardialers(lazy hacker-wannabe, you'll 
say, but without UNIX, what else could I have done ?? Getting 
        a shell account from my ISP is impossible...here in Austria 
        there aren't too many providers...)....So should I get Red Hat 
        or will Minkey suffice for hacking ?? I got 3,5 GB so HD-space 
        is not a problem.....

                                         THANX in advance, 
                                                       ACE

[Jon: I've never heard of Monkey Linux, but all you really need is 
      a version of linux that will support networking with SLIP or 
      PPP. ]

5. Downloading Linux 
From: Andip Unknown <andi_panda@hotmail.com>

I just wondered if u knew where i could get a hold of Linux, and not just 
different applications and utilities. I would like to download/buy a copy of 
the 
whole operating system. I tried to dowload something called Doslinux which was 
supposed to be working from dos/doswindow without deleting my win95 setup, i 
think. This didn't work, when i tried to decompress it it just used up all the 
space on my harddrive.

Thanx in advance

AndrÃ©

[Jon: How much space do you have on your hard drive? Linux is gonna 
      take upwards of 10 MB of space. Any distribution of Linux will 
      run concurrently with Win95, as long as it supports/includes 
      LILO. ]

Linux is a Unix clone for PCs, Macs, and a couple other systems.

Yes, you can keep your old operating system.  I believe there is a way to 
partition the Mac disk so that MacOS resides on one portion and LinuxMK 
on the other.  Anyone running Lmk know this to be true?

>the other? this questions is SO elementary every site just overlooks 
>it.

Well, I'm not sure about MKLinux, since I don't have a powermac to play 
with :( but I do run MacBSD on an old 68k IIcx that I've got lying around. 
I assume that the procedure is about the same.

You will be able to keep MacOS on your computer but it won't be running at 
the same time. You will have to make a second and third partition (or third 
and fourth if you already have two) on your hard drive that you will store 
Linux on. One is for all the files, and the other is for SWAP (like a disk 
cache). After you have installed all the files with installers (available 
from www.mklinux.apple.org I *think*), you will then run a little program 
called a booter. What this does is effectively quit MacOS and start running 
Linux. To go back to MacOS, you will have to restart (the command I use is 
halt) and then your mac will boot back into macOS.

I *highly* recommend trying this, because for hacking, UNIX just rules, no 
competition!

If you simply want to run a simple web server from your mac, try MacHTTP 
1.0. It's probably available from www.shareware.com and is definitely 
available from www.starnine.com. It's free, and it works like a charm for 
low traffic sites that don't need lots of scripts (although it can quite 
easily be done).

I hope that answers your question, and whatever you do, if you think you 
can handle it, DO install linux, it will prove invaluable in your hacking 
career.

8. Some Guestions 
From: *Anonymous*

Hi there,

1.  Is it possible to telnet into someones computer and shutting in 
down. Or remote it. The computer is a normal PC, not a server or 
workstation.

[ Jon: There is software that allows you to dial in and turn a PC off, 
       but under normal circumstances, you can not telnet into a PC 
       and shut it down. ]

2. Wanna get a shell account for free, goto www.cyberspace.org.

3. Which is much recomended to use. Slakware, Redhat or Monkey for 
Linux.

[ Jon: Its all a matter of preference. I hear RedHat is really easy to 
       install. I've only used Slackware. Each has its pro's and con's. ]

ps. If you feel that this shoulb be anonymous please post it up in 
the     digest.

[ Jon: I will make any posts anonymous, just ask. ]

9. linux on laptop 
From: Redington <nemesis@minot.com>

I am in the process of installing Linux on my 133 pentium notebook, I 
have almost everything complete except two things.  I can't get it to 
mount my PC Card modem, I have everything else setup like minicom etc, 
does anyone know by any chance what the location is for the PC card 
modem dev? The other thing is that when I startx the only way I can 
get 
it to work is if I have it in really low resolution because it doesn't 
list any monitors or graphic cards that are like mine.  I have emailed 
RedHat (oh yeah its Redhat 4.1, installing from CD) and they say they 
will get back to me on it eventually, but I thought in the mean time 
someone out there on HH might be able to help me out.

Thanks,

neMEsis

[ Jon: See the PCMCIA howto for more info, it may answer your question 
       http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/PCMCIA-HOWTO.html 
       As far as resolution goes, try to find out which chipset your 
       accellerator uses. Otherwise, your out of luck. ]

*** Note From Matt 
=============================================================================

Hello Happy Hackers,

Well, for me, class is over, *finally*, for the summer. I do have a 
couple of final exams left to ace, but studying for them won't be more 
time consuming than class. This summer will be exciting. I will attend 
a few hacker conferences and I landed a job at an ISP doing what I 
(all of us, for that matter) enjoy most: messing around on computers. 
Return of the BOFH! Of course, who cares about my personal life, 
right? :) Anyway, The latest Guide To (mostly) Harmless Hacking was 
just released, and if you haven't read it yet, you can snag a copy

I have read that on some systems there is a vulnerability in which if

Ftp can upload a .rhosts file to this directory and use rlogin from 
his system to access the target system.

My question is..what does an .rhosts file look like? Is there some 
special format that it is in similiar to that of the passwd file?

*** Windows NT 4.0 SAM Hotfix 
=============================================================================

From: Aleph One <aleph1@DFW.NET> 
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, version 4.0 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY 
=======

The Windows NT Server 4.0 System Key hotfix provides the capability to 
use strong encryption techniques to increase protection of account 
password information stored in the registry by the Security Account 
Manager (SAM). Windows NT Server stores user account information, 
including a derivative of the user account password, in a secure 
portion of the Registry protected by access control and an obfuscation 
function. The account information in the Registry is only accessible 
to members of the Administrators group. Windows NT Server, like other 
operating systems, allows privileged users who are administrators 
access to all resources in the system. For installations that want 
enhanced security, strong encryption of account password derivative 
information provides an additional level of security to prevent 
Administrators from intentionally or unintentionally accessing 
password derivatives using Registry programming interfaces.

STATUS 
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 
version 4.0.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully 
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing 
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this 
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next 
Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical 
Support for more information.

MORE INFORMATION 
================

The strong encryption capability with the Windows NT 4.0 System Key 
hotfix is an optional feature. Administrators may choose to implement 
strong encryption by defining a System Key for Windows NT. Strong 
encryption protects private account information by encrypting the 
password data using a 128-bit cryptographically random key, known as a 
password encryption key. Only the private password information is 
strongly encrypted in the database, not the entire account database. 
Every system using the strong encryption option will have a unique 
password encryption key. The password encryption key is itself 
encrypted with a System Key. Strong password encryption may be used on 
both Windows NT Server and Workstation where account information is 
stored. Using strong encryption of account passwords adds additional 
protection for the contents of the SAM portion of the registry and 
subsequent backup copies of the registry information in the 
%systemroot%\repair directory created using the RDISK command and on 
system backup tapes.

The System Key is defined using the command SYSKEY.EXE. Only members 
of the Administrators group can run the SYSKEY.EXE command. The 
utility is used to initialize or change the System Key. The System Key 
is the "master key" used to protect the password encryption key and 
therefore protection of the System Key is a critical system security 
operation.

There are three options for managing the System Key designed to meet 
the needs of different Windows NT environments. The System Key options 
are the following:

- Use a machine generated random key as the System Key and store the 
key on the local system using a complex obfuscation algorithm. This 
option provides strong encryption of password information in the 
registry and allows for unattended system restart.

- Use a machine generated random key and store the key on a floppy 
disk. The floppy disk with the System Key is required for the system 
to start and must be inserted when prompted after Windows NT begins 
the startup sequence, but before the system is available for users to 
logon. The System Key is not stored anywhere on the local system.

- Use a password chosen by the Administrator to derive the System Key. 
Windows NT will prompt for the System Key password when the system is 
in the initial startup sequence, but before the system is available 
for users to logon. The System Key password is not stored anywhere on 
the system. An MD5 digest of the password is used as the master key to 
protect the password encryption key.

The System Key options using either a password or requiring a floppy 
disk introduce a new prompt during the initialization of the Windows 
NT operating system. They offer the strongest protection option 
available because master key material is not stored on the system and 
control of the key can be restricted to a few individuals. On the 
other hand, knowledge of the System Key password, or possession of the 
System Key diskette is required to boot the system. (If the System Key 
is saved to a floppy disk, backup copies of the System Key diskette 
are recommended.) Unattended system restart may require that System 
Key material be available to the system without Administrator 
response. Storing the System Key on the local system using a complex 
obfuscation algorithm makes the key available only to core operating 
system security components. In the future, it will be possible to 
configure the System Key to obtain the key material from tamper 
proof hardware components for maximum security.

WARNING: If the System Key password is forgotten or the System Key 
floppy disk lost it may not be possible to start the system. Protect 
and store the System Key information safely with backup copies in the 
event of emergency. The only way to recover the system if the System 
Key is lost is using a repair disk to restore the registry to a state 
prior to enabling strong encryption. See the Repair Issues section 
below.

Strong encryption may be configured independently on the Primary and 
each Backup Domain Controllers (DCs). Each domain controller will have 
a unique password encryption key and a unique System Key. For example, 
the Primary DC may be configured to use a machine generated System Key 
stored on a diskette, and Backup DCs may each use a different machine 
generated System Key stored on the local system. A machine generated 
System Key stored locally on a Primary domain controller is not 
replicated.

Before enabling strong encryption for Primary domain controllers, you 
may want to ensure a complete updated Backup domain controller is 
available to use as a backup system until changes to the Primary 
domain are complete and verified. Before enabling strong encryption on 
any system, Microsoft recommends making a fresh copy of the Emergency 
Repair Disk, including the security information in the registry, using 
the command, RDISK /S.

The SYSKEY command is used to select the System Key option and 
generate the initial key value. The key value may be either a machine 
generated key or a password derived key. The SYSKEY command first 
displays a dialog showing whether strong encryption is enabled or 
disabled. After the strong encryption capability is enabled, it cannot 
be disabled. To enable strong authentication of the account database, 
select the option "Encryption Enabled", and click OK. A confirm dialog 
appears reminding the administrator to make an updated emergency 
repair disk. A new dialog appears presenting options for the Account 
Database Key. Use the options available on Account Database Key dialog 
to select the System Key.

After selecting the System Key option, Windows NT must be restarted 
for the System Key option to take effect. When the system restarts, 
the administrator may be prompted to enter the System Key, depending 
on the key option chosen. Windows NT detects the first use of the 
System Key and will generate a new random password encryption key. The 
password encryption key is protected with the System Key, and then all 
account password information is strongly encrypted.

The SYSKEY command needs to be run on each system where strong 
encryption of the account password information is required. SYSKEY 
supports a "-l" command option to generate the master key and store 
the key locally on the system. This option enables strong password 
encryption in the registry and allows the command to run without an 
interactive dialog. The SYSKEY command can be used at a later time to 
change the System Key options from one method to another, or to change 
the System Key to a new key. Changing the System Key requires 
knowledge of, or possession of, the current System Key. If the 
password derived System Key option is used, SYSKEY does not enforce 
a minimum password length, however long passwords (greater than 12 
characters) are recommended. The maximum System Key password length is 
128 characters.

REPAIR ISSUES 
-------------

Introduction of strong encryption of account password information 
changes the SYSTEM and SAM portions of the registry in ways that 
effect the repair options available for recovery of a Windows NT 
system. Always use the RDISK command with the /S option to create a 
new Emergency Repair Disk including a backup copy of the SYSTEM and 
SAM portion of registry in the \repair directory.

For complete recovery options, the following Emergency Repair Disks 
should be available:

- Prior to installing the System Key hotfix, create a fresh repair 
disk. This disk is a "pre-hotfix" repair disk that contains a copy of 
the system configuration and account information prior to installation 
of the hotfix. The "pre-hotfix" repair disk may be used to recover the 
registry and system files using the Windows NT distribution CDROM.

- After installation of the System Key hotfix, but before enabling 
strong encryption using the SYSKEY command, create a repair disk. This 
repair disk is "hotfix - Before Encryption". This repair disk can be 
used to repair the Registry to the state before strong encryption is 
enabled, for example it may be used to recover a system if the Windows 
NT System Key is lost or forgotten.

- After running SYSKEY to enable strong encryption, create a repair 
disk. This repair disk is "hotfix - After Encryption". This repair 
disk, and subsequent updates to this repair disk, can be used recover 
the registry with strong encryption intact using the System Key in 
effect at the time the repair disk was last updated.

The System Key hotfix support for strong encryption affects the 
following system components:

- SYSTEM and SAM registry hives

- Three system security component files: Winlogon.exe, Samsrv.dll, 
Samlib.dll

In general, the repair process needs to use matching versions of these 
components. Whatever repair option you choose, the repair process will 
coordinate repair of the registry hives with the matching system 
files.

The following table lists the recovery options available.
