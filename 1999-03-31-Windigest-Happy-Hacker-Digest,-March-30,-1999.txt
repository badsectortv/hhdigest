I guess you could say that this edition of the HHD is sort ofthe NT 
sysadmins' edition.  Yes, most of what's in this edition seems to be 
directed toward NT sysadmins...but hopefully this sort of thing will open up 
opportunities for our readers...as NT sysadmins.  After all, isn't that the 
only 100%, guaranteed method of 'getting root'?

Subj: netcat

Hi Happy Hackers! :) in the feb. 14 HH Windows edition our editor put 
something about Netcat, an Interesting and Obscure Network Tool; this tool 
like Hobbit say in his .txt, had many uses (1001) heh! well i found this 
tiny sotfware very interesting, and I had made many experiments with it. 
Waiting for the promised "Innovative ways to use" i put here some of the 
uses i had discovered for NetCat:

C:\nc11nt>nc -v -v -L 127.0.0.1 -p 23

DNS fwd/rev mismatch: localhost != darkstar listening on [any] 23 ... 
DNS fwd/rev mismatch: localhost != darkstar connect to [127.0.0.1] from 
localhost [127.0.0.1] 1131 
login: sniff password: Hehe!!

Well, what we have here? it looks like a sniffer!!! :) the option -v 
(verbose) in combination with the option -L (listen and listen again) Let 
netcat listen in any ports for conections , then if i do telnet to localhost 
(127.0.0.1) from another window, netcat let me see what its happening in 
this port. B-]

         A quick one:

C:\nc11nt>nc -v -v -z 127.0.0.1 53 25 21

DNS fwd/rev mismatch: localhost != darkstar 
localhost [127.0.0.1] 53 (domain): connection refused 
localhost [127.0.0.1] 25 (smtp): connection refused 
localhost [127.0.0.1] 21 (ftp): connection refused 
sent 0, rcvd 0: NOTSOCK

Hmmm... A little Port scanner!. Yes, you can scan any port you want, or you 
can do a simple scan-range of ports like in this example:

C:\nc11nt>nc -v -v -z 127.0.0.1 1-53

DNS fwd/rev mismatch: localhost != darkstar 
localhost [127.0.0.1] 53 (domain): connection refused 
localhost [127.0.0.1] 52 (?): connection refused 
localhost [127.0.0.1] 51 (?): connection refused 
localhost [127.0.0.1] 50 (?): connection refused 
localhost [127.0.0.1] 49 (?): connection refused 
etc... 
 

Also, you can use netcat as a "Doctor_X Scanner Detector" (tm), let him 
listen in any port and redirect the input to a file:

C:\nc11nt>nc -v -L  hostname  -p 54 > intrudres.txt

Yes, if someone is scanning your Box, netcat capture his IP address and put 
it in a file called "intruders.txt" Hehe!! then you can use your favorite 
LART againts the little one who spy you... B-] 
 

There are many others uses for this proggie, any one with others "Innovative 
Ways"?? :) 
 

         Saludos!

Sugj: Boot execute program potential vulnerability

Howdy,

that's me again. I think you have a lot of post from the list subscribers, 
so it's a good idea to not bother you without a reason. I've been studying 
some books on Windows programming, but I still can't get the things 
together. Maybe I am too dumb for that.  However, I noticed something that 
had attracted my attention. There is a kind of NT programs, called "Boot 
execute" 'cause they run at the system sturtup, like CheckDisk does. Since 
the LSA subsistem hasn't started yet, the processes run by those programs 
can bypass security restrictions. Now the hard part. For a boot execute 
program to be executed, it must have a matching string in the registry, but 
Write access to that part of the  registry is restricted to the privilegied 
users. However, there  is a possibility (at least, theoretically) to 
exchange chkdsk.exe  with a Trojan due to defaul permissions to this file. 
Hence, an attacker writes a Trojan which is intended to copy  contents of 
SAM file to a file with Full Control for Everyone,  compiles it as Boot 
execute, calls it chkdsk.exe and overwrite  the original chkdsk.exe file 
with it.  When the system is rebooted,  the trojan is being executed. Since 
SAM file is not locked yet (I suppose so), it contents can be easily copied.

Unfortunately, I don't have enough programmer's skills to prove or refute 
this. Would it be a good idea to ask the list for help in  this matter?

Regards, 
Vladimir.

[Editor:  Sure, there are lots of ways to 'trojan' NT, even if you are just 
a user.  Changing the Aedebug Registry key, etc. I haven't seen this 
one...maybe you could send an email to L0pht and see if they've done any 
work in this area.  Of course, there are other things you can do...run rdisk 
to get the latest SAM file, etc.]

SamSpade Update

SamSpade, a great tool for Windows users, has moved from the  Blighty site 
to http://www.samspade.org.  If you check out the site, you can d/l the 
latest version of SamSpade or use any of the online tools that the author 
has provided...tools such as an online ping, traceroute, and even a DNS 
query tool.  Check it out, and d/l the latest version of SamSpade.

NT Commands (Unix-like and networking)

Let's continue our look at NT commands - and in doing so, I want to briefly 
mention some Unix-like commands that you can get  from the NT Resource Kit. 
Now, these aren't the same as those you can find at NT-Unix web sites...but 
if you do a lot of Unix  administration, pull these programs off of the RK, 
and it might make you life a little easier:

>From the Resource Kit, native Win32 commands (have POSIX  versions): 
cat.exe, cp.exe, ls.exe, mv.exe, touch.exe, wc.exe, vi.exe

>From the Resource Kit, as POSIX: chmod.exe, chown.exe, find.exe, grep.exe, 
ln.exe mkdir.exe, rm.exe, rmdir.exe, sh.exe

As long as we're on the subject of RK commands, you might want to check out 
the following Microsoft KnowledgeBase articles:

Q171591:  Syntax Examples of WinNT Server Registry Resource Kit Utilities  
Q158388:  Useful Resource Kit Utilities for Domain Administrators

Also, check out utilities such as NewSID.exe from Systems Internals at 
http://www.sysinternals.com, and DumpACL, DumpReg, and DumpEvt from 
Somarsoft, Inc, at http://www.somarsoft.com.

NOTE:  For a pretty good list of programs in general, check out: 
http://www.microsoft.com/NTServer/nts/exec/vendors/freeshare/default.asp

Networking commands nbtstat.exe, net.exe, ping.exe, tracert.exe, nslookup.exe

The online help with NT does a pretty fair job of providing a  look at what 
all of these commands do.  In the past, we have  looked at Perl scripts that 
made use of nbtstat.exe, and you  can also use Perl to tie net.exe into 
scripts as well.  Net.exe has several configuration options which can be 
found in the  online help, or by simply typing 'net /?' at the command 
prompt. Getting further information on the various configuration options is 
just as easy...simply type 'net view /?' or 'net use /?', or whichever 
option you choose.

The command that deserves a good review is nslookup.exe.  This  command is 
used to submit DNS queries, and troubleshoot DNS problems.

Here is the text of the Guide To (mostly) Harmless Hacking on  DNS regarding 
nslookup:

----- begin ----- 
[nslookup]

Nslookup is a great little tool for making DNS queries that comes with NT, 
Linux, etc.  The easiest way to use nslookup is in non- interactive mode. 
This means that you submit a request at the command line, and you get a 
response back with no other input. For example, from the command prompt, type:

$nslookup foobar.edu

Server:  localhost 
Address: 127.0.0.1

Name:    foobar.edu 
Address: 289.13.266.37

The Server and Address response you see above will vary depending upon your 
operating system, and how it's set up.  But you can see that this is a quick 
and easy way to look up the IP address of  a host given the name...we have 
performed a query for the "A"  resource record.  We can do a "reverse 
lookup" by entering the  IP address at the command prompt, rather than the 
host name:

$nslookup 289.13.266.37

Server:  localhost 
Address: 127.0.0.1

Name:     www.foobar.edu 
Address:  289.13.266.37

Wait a minute!  What's this "www.foobar.edu" stuff?  Well,  what we've found 
is an alias for the host "foobar.edu".  A  single host can have multiple 
host names that all point to  the same IP address. 

The other way to play with nslookup is to enter interactive mode  by typing 
"nslookup" (with no arguments) at the command prompt, and then hitting 
<Enter>.  You will get a prompt back that looks  
like:

>

>From here you can enter commands.  For example, type:

>foobar.edu

Wow!  We get the same information back as we did for the non- interactive 
mode query.  To look up specific resource records  for the foobar.edu 
domain, all we need to do is tell nslookup which RR type we want:

>set type=<RR>

where <RR> refers to the resource record type, as we saw listed above (A, 
PTR, MX, CNAME, etc).  This way you can look up just those records you are 
interested in.  Note:  If you enter "ANY" in place of "<RR>", you will be 
doing a lookup in the domain for all resource records...mail exchangers 
(email servers), name servers, etc.

Now, let's try one more little trick.  This involves listing hosts  within 
the domain we are interested in...it doesn't mean _all_ of  the hosts, 
though.  We already know the names and IP addresses of the nameservers that 
point to foobar.edu, so start nslookup in  interactive mode.  Then change 
the nameserver used to resolve  queries to the nameserver that points to the 
foobar.edu domain:

$nslookup

Once you're in interactive mode, change the default nameserver that is used 
to resolve your queries to a nameserver that points to the foobar.edu 
domain...this information was retrieved using the whois query above:

>server 287.128.192.4

Now we want to list the hosts in the domain that have records available, so 
type: 

>ls foobar.edu

You will see something similar to:

[ns01.nameserver.org] 
foobar.edu.           server = ns.nameserver.org        
     
foobar.edu.           server = ns2.nameserver.org      
foobar.edu.           server = ns3.nameserver.org 
foobar.edu.           289.13.266.37 
ftp                   289.13.266.37 
smtp                  289.13.266.37 
www                   289.13.266.37

In the real world (vice the "example" world) you will likely get a lot more 
hosts back than this...in fact, you may get  upwards to 500 or more hosts! 
However, what this tells us is that the host "foobar.edu" has the same IP 
address as the hosts listed as "ftp", "smtp", and "www".  This means that 
these are services aliased to the host...performing a lookup on 
"ftp.foobar.edu" or trying to connect to "ftp.foobar.edu" will 
point or connect you to the host "foobar.edu".

If you do list the hosts in the domain, you may want to use  redirection to 
save this information in a file, so that you can read over it:

>ls foobar.edu > foobar.txt 
----- end -----

This is a very basic overview of how to use nslookup.  The  NT online help 
has a some further information, specifically on how to configure specific 
queries from the command line. For example, to lookup information on a 
particular computer in another domain, type in something similar to:

nslookup -querytype=any domain server

where 'domain' is the domain you are interested in, and 'server'  is the 
name server to be queried for the information.  If this is  left blank, the 
default name server will be used.  This makes  the nslookup tool great for 
scripting and using with Perl...

****************************************************************** 
Win9x shares on the Internet

A while ago, I wrote an updated Guide To (mostly) Harmless Hacking that 
addressed accessing 9x shares over the Internet while using  9x.  It seems 
that the first edition of the Guide, which was  written for NT, was spread 
wide and far, and almost no one has  seen the updated, 9x version.  That 
version is at:

http://www.patriot.net/users/carvdawg/win95.txt

and,

http://www.happyhacker.org/crack295.htm

Now, I want to point out that much of the research for the second version 
was done via the Microsoft KnowledgeBase at:

http://support.microsoft.com

Specifically, the following articles were used:

Q178729:  How to configure Win95 to dial into a RAS/RRAS  server (pay 
particular attention to steps 1 and 3a.) 
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q178/7/29.asp 
  
Q145843:  How to connect to a remote server 
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q145/8/43.asp 

Q183368:  Requirements to browse network with dial-up  networking 
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q183/3/68.asp 
  
Other articles of interest include:

Q180099:  Troubleshooting LMHOSTS Name Resolution Issues 
Q156323:  Error 3787: You Must Log on Before Performing this Operation 
(applies to Win95) 
Q141229:  How to use the Net View command to view shared resources

If you are having trouble accessing shares over the Internet, whether 
sharing files or 'wargaming' with your friends, take a look at these articles.  

Anyone running 'nbtstat -A a.b.c.d' has likely been frustrated  with the 
'host not found' response.  This can be caused by  several things...the 
target host isn't connected to the Internet, a firewall is blocking the UDP 
queries, etc.  However, doing a  search on the Micrsoft KnowledgeBase 
(http://support.microsoft.com) leads to article Q175935 'NBTSTAT -A May 
Return Host not Found Error Message'.  This article applies to NT only...and 
the stated cause is that 'the NetBIOS Interface device on the target 
computer is not started'.  The solution is to set the Messenger Service to 
automatic, and set the NetBIOS Interface device in the Devices icon in the 
Control Panel to either automatic or manual.  

I have yet to find anything similar in Win9x.

Perl Corner

In this Perl Corner I'll go ahead and introduce some of the Win32  modules. 
We've already looked at Win32 functions, so this time  we'll look at modules 
that have been written for NT and '9x.   Now, a word of warning...most of 
these modules only work on NT.  

Perl for Win32 
http://www.netaxs.com/~joc/perlwin32.html 
This site has a very comprehensive list of Win32 modules.  Check it out 
before writing a script of your own...there may be a  module available that 
will make your life easier.

Perlwin32 Modules 
http://www.generation.net/~cybersky/Perl/perlmod.htm 
Check these modules out!  PortIO, IPHelp, DES, and more!

Phillip LeBerre's site 
http://www.inforoute.cgs.fr/leberre1/ 
Links to download and docs for Registry, EventLog, and  Services modules.

Dave Roth's site (Roth Consulting) 
http://www.roth.net/ 
Home of the AdminMisc module, as well as Win32::ODBC and Win32::Perms...all 
three of which are MUST HAVES! Also, I've been working through Dave's book, 
"Windows NT Win32 Perl Programming"...it's a gold mine for NT admins!!

For any of these modules, simply follow the installation  instructions 
provided by the author.  Dave Roth has set up (at least some of) his modules 
to be installed via the PPM script that ships with ActivePerl (see 
c:\perl\bin\ppm.pl).

That being said...

If you want to see what services are running on your NT box, run the 
following script:

----- begin svcs.pl ----- 
#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exe

use Win32::Service; 
my ($key, %service, %status, $part); 
Win32::Service::GetServices('',\%services);

foreach $key (sort keys %services) { 
   print "Display Name\t: $key, $services{$key}\n";

   Win32::Service::GetStatus( '',$services{$key}, 
\%status);

   foreach $part (keys %status) { 
     print "\t$part : $status{$part}\n" if ($part eq 
"CurrentState"); 
   } 
} 
----- end svcs.pl -----

Notice that we only look at the current state of the service. If we remove 
'if ($part eq "CurrentState")' from the 13th line of the file, we'll see all 
of the information that the module provides.  Also, in line 5, we see the 
call to enumerate the services:

Win32::Service::GetServices('',\%services);

The first argument to the function is null, represented by ''.   This tells 
the function to obtain the services from the local machine...we could easily 
have checked other machines in the domain by providing their names via an 
array or having them read from a file.

Would you like to take a look at some Registry data?  Okay, I'll use a 
simple example from pg. 173 of 'Learning Perl on Win32 Systems' from 
O'Reilly and Assoc:

-----  begin reg.pl  ----- 
#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exe

use Win32::Registry;

# If you are using Win9x, change 'Windows NT' in 
# the line below to 'Windows'

$p = "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows 
NT\\CurrentVersion"; 
$main::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->Open($p, $CurrVer) ||  
  die "Open:  $!\n"; 
$CurrVer->GetValues(\%vals); 
foreach $k (keys %vals) { 
  $key = $vals{$k}; 
  print "$$key[0] = $$key[2]\n"; 
} 
-----  end reg.pl  -----

Dave Roth's Win32::AdminMisc module has a variety of methods that allow you 
to do all sorts of things on your NT box, or within your NT domain.  You can 
get drive and volume data, manage user accounts, even check to see if user's 
password is in a dictionary file.  

Dave Roth's book, mentioned above, has a great little example in which he 
demonstrates the use of several modules to gather errors in EventLogs on 
several machines.  The script makes use of Win32::OLE to put the gathered 
data into an Excel  spreadsheet.  Such a script can be set to run each 
morning prior to the sysadmin's arrival, and can show such things as failed 
logins, etc, from across several machines.  It's not real-time, but if you 
want a simple intrusion detection tool, such a script would work.  Also, 
Dave Roth wrote the Win32:: ODBC module, so you could have the data dumped 
to a database instead of a spreadsheet...whatever you choose.

As I stated in the 1 Feb '99 edition of the HHD in the Perl  Corner, you can 
also use Perl modules to generate information or warning events into the 
Event Log on NT.
