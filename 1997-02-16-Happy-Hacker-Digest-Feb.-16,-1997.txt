   I don't know if anyone's going to go to the effort to do it - I doubt 
it - but I'm fairly sure it's not impermeable.  At a minimum, it may be 
crashable.  A buffer overflow could actually kill the entire Mac, because 
there's no protected memory in system 7.x.  Hacking it would present a 
large technical challenge to anyone, however.  You'd almost have to have 
it write a little server that you could connect to, or something.  Not 
pretty.

Just to make this a little clearer, I was not saying a MAC is not hackable, 
but the WebSTAR Web server they are running at that site. I have worked with 
it and it's very simple design leaves little to look into. It's like setting 
up a Microsoft Front Page server on a Windows 95 run computer. (Well kinda, 
after all it is a MAC) I'm not saying it's UN-hackable, but 99% UN-hackable ;)

True. However, a few months back, a contest was set up by Quarterdeck, the 
makers of Webstar, the best webserver on the planet (bias? yep.) to see if 
ANYONE could hack their site. $10,000 was the reward, all correct legal venues 
were used: Quarterdeck lost no money. I'd like to see THAT on WinNT.

I work at an ISP where, for two years, we've been running on Macs. Although no 
one's tried on us yet, I've found that the Mac has had many attempts made on it- 
no success yet. That may seem like a broad, sweeping statement, but it's true. 
More people out there use Macs for serving than some people think- there's a 
reason for that.

New, improved. Not to mention the fact that it's not going to even... well, 
you'll see for yourself, I'm sure. The hybrid OS is not going to be based on 
UNIX, just have some of its advantages.

TELNET TROUBLES

From: "Roy Hasson" <candyman@voicenet.com>

Hi, I was looking for a terminal program so I can access Telnet, because 
whenever I try to log on Telnet I get a bunch of characters as the prompts 
and as the text I input. Can anyone tell me where can I get this kind of 
terminal program ? 
Thanks ..

Moderator: Sounds like you are using a telnet program that doesn't handle a 
PPP connection. Either get a program that does work with PPP such as the 
Win95 or Quarterdeck telnet programs.

UPTIGHT ISP

From: Nils van den Heuvel <n.heuvel@pi.net>

Hi,

I have been looking for a provider that offers shell accounts, I have 
found one in my country (Holland) that does, but they say: "We can't 
allow our users to hack servers outside of our domain (www.xs4all.nl), 
you can only hack our machines."

Now, I have 2 questions:

1) Is this really possible?

2) Is there a way to bypass their security, so I can hack whatever I 
want?

I hope you can help me,

Nils van den Heuvel 
n.heuvel@pi.net

Moderator: I don't know the law in your country as of today. But the 
government of Holland has long been (in)famous for letting hackers do almost 
anything. On the other hand, chances are that your ISP also has the right to 
close your account if they don't like what you are doing.

I've found it helps to make friends with the sysadmins at my ISP so they 
feel like I'm not going to do anything horrible while hacking. On the other 
hand, as a 50-year-old mom, I don't exactly fit the hacker profile.

Perhaps some of the other Dutch hackers on this list could help Nils find a 
friendlier ISP?

MORE LINUX QUESTIONS

From: root <root@ruined.all-net.net>

This is to the person who was having problems with his /etc/resolv.conf.

I didn't see an explanation of what to put there. So I'd thought it'd be 
worth mentioning that the unresolved IP of his ISP's DNS servers need to 
be there in the format :

nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 
  
You can list as many as you like. ;)

From: "Roger A. Prata" <prata@cyber-wizard.com>

Carolyn,  I hope you can help me here.  I currently downloaded (over 4 
nights) all the /base and /rpms files for RedHat 4.0, as well as the 
boot.img and supp.img.  I am trying to install from my HD to a dedicated 
partition for Linux:

/dev/hda1  (c:\)  is for Win95 
/dev/hda2   is for Linux (linux native partition)

when I try to choose source media, it asks which partition and DIRECTORY 
the media is in.   The source files are on /dev/hda1   (C:\)  off the root 
dir.  so they are c:\rpms and c:\base.   When asked which directory on 
/dev/hda1, I have tried /, /mnt, /dos, /mnt/dos, etc..  I cannot get it. 
can you help??

TIA,

Rog 
 

LEGAL STUPH

Since when is a war dialer software program illegal?! In some counties in 
some states there are statutes against wardialing, but no federal laws 
regulating the software that does it.

Technically/Legally, having a cracked password with a valid login 
constitutes having an "illegal access device". Someone verify this please, 
but I *think* each such device is a Class 5 felony now.

So you consider MLK a hacker by your previous guides... interesting.

Moderator: Hackers can learn a lot from MLK, Gandhi and Jesus. Too many 
hackers get in trouble for a tendency to let being a vigilante overstep the 
bounds of the law. Cracking and email bombing come to mind. Now possessing 
war dialing software -- I haven't heard of that being illegal, either. But 
using it in the US sure is.

I wanted to thank k1neTiK for elaberating on my sendmail/Identd post. I 
wanted to put it into "laymans" terms, but after thinking about it I should 
of put it in real terms to.

I also wanted to inform people that most servers, about 80% to 90%, run 
Identd, including most (if not all) ISPs and commercial providers. The few 
sites that are left that don't run Identd are schools/colleges, home 
systems, old servers that were not meant to be sending mail, but have it 
running anyway, and systems who's sysadmin are clueless. I also, after 
looking HARD for laws that might concern e-mail bombings use of other peoples 
servers, I found some little scraps of information. If you use another 
server to pass mail to someone other than a user on that system, or to 
yourself, and if you do something HARMFULL, like crash their server with 
mail, you can be held liable, if caught. The fines and levels of the crime, 
from with I could gather, very from state to state, and depending on the 
damage done, if any. The only loop hole I could find was this: These was DO 
NOT apply internationally, so you could use a server in Germany all day long 
to punish someone here in the states. Well there are still problems if you 
get caught on this end, like your ISP booting you for being naughty ;)

PLEASE, this is NOT the law. These are scraps of information I gathered for 
your better understanding of what could happen you get caught. The Laws 
vary from State to State.

Moderator: Email bombing is a denial of service attack. If the attack 
crosses state lines it is illegal in the United States under 18 USC, Chapter 
47, Section 1030. Sure, you could use a server outside the US to launch an 
attack. But you would have to worry about getting caught if you were to be 
found in the US. Penalty is fine and/or up to 1 year in prison for first 
offense, and up to 10 years in prison if it is a repeat offense.

Does anyone know what are the laws in some other countries? We have lots of 
people on this list from around the world. In fact, now is a good time to 
give some demographics from this list.

MORE CALM, MEASURED DISCOURSE

From: "ruben d canlas jr" <benc@skyinet.net>

mulder@ntplx.net said: 
  
> If I see a site that I personally find distasteful, it no 
> more gives me the right to persecute it and attempt to get it removed than 
> it gives a nazi the right to attempt to destroy a Jewish homepage.

mulder, thanks for bringing this up. it will set us to thinking 
deeply on the philosophy of protest, which I think is a natural 
aspect present in all hackers.

I'd like to argue on two levels. here's the first:

there is a big difference between arguing in the abstract and in the 
concrete. for instance, you are using the nazi experience to validate 
that violating children is not offensive.

the nazi experience is racial. sexual abuse of children is definitely 
a different matter. it is not just abuse, it is taking advantage of 
the innocent. that is the concrete level of this issue.

you just can't generalize based on the nazi example.

the second level:

our upbringing shapes the way we think. if we were brought up to 
react against something "immoral", we can't help that unless we are 
made to see the consequences of our violent actions.

in any case, what is good about the net is that if you vandalize a 
site, you are not creating any physical damage. since you are against 
the idea that is on the site, you are just showing your protest 
against that idea, by means of another idea.

also: to proceed from mulder's argument, if everyone must be open, 
then there should also be a provision for striking a balance between 
a pro and a con.

if someone puts up a website I don't like, I should be able to 
respond to that website on equal terms.

sending protest email to the offending webmaster is not equal 
enough, because the offending website is, after all, a website. email 
disappears in anonymity, unless of course the offending webmaster 
publishes it in their website.

arguing this way, we see that the appropriate equal response is to 
put up a website that denounces the offensive website.

and in the spirit of a true openness, I will send to the offending 
webmaster the URL of my "anti-website".

but will the offending webmaster put a prominent link to my website 
on his own website?

the answer to this question will show how open people truly are.

sending protest email to the offending webmaster is not equal 
enough, because the offending website is, after all, a website. email 
disappears in anonymity, unless of course the offending webmaster 
publishes it in their website.
