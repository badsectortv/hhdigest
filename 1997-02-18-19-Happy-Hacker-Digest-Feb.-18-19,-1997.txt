EMAIL BOMB PROGRAM WENT OOPSIE!

(I want to start off by saying that I DO WANT THIS MESSAGE TO BE KEPT 
ANONYMOUS please.  Hey there.  I want to start off by saying that I love 
the happy hacker digest series.  I am very much a newbie, but with the aide 
of your newsletters, I am constantly learning more and more.  I do have a 
concern though.  I had downloaded avalanche 2.0 and was using it to try to 
learn about mail bombs.  I know, I should've done my homework first instead 
of finding software first off.  Now I know.  How ever, I was playing around 
with the program (specifically, the mail list mail bombing function) I 
entered a friend of mine's e-mail address and started sending.  It was very 
quick.  It may have taken about a second or two.  I didn't think it worked 
so I sent one to my address.  I only got hit with 1 mail list, but I have a 
feeling that my friend was not so lucky, I estimate that he may have been 
hit by about 300-400 lists.  I feel really bad.  Is there a program I can 
get that will un-subscribe him?  I never meant to do that to him.  This is 
a lesson well learned by me.  Now I know that just getting some programs 
doesn't make a hacker.  You can be assured that now I very much do my 
homework first.  I would really appreciate any help you can give me. 
Thanks allot.  Keep up the good work.

CRACKER Q&A

It is not unusual for a server to allow it's passwd file to be downloaded, 
but you will find that 99 times out of a 100, it will be shadowed.  Open it 
with a text file, and if you see something like this:

root:*:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash 
bin:*:1:1:bin:/bin: 
daemon:*:2:2:daemon:/sbin: 
adm:*:3:4:adm:/var/adm: 
lp:*:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:

Then it is shadowed.  Normally you would see encrypted characters where the 
* was.  Oh yeah, and after running it through a passwd cracker, you 
hopefully would get some valid passwords and then you could use them to login.

Also, on a different note, for everyone that has asked questions about 
Finger, it is detailed in RFC1288.

p.s.  My Web Site (the URL of the day for the Feb 17 issue) now has almost 
all the digests since October, a few cool links, and a tutorial on how to 
find out what a port does, or how to find out info about a specific daemon/port.

p.s.s Are there any known bugs/vulnerabilities in Identd?

Moderator: I made this one anonymous. Sheesh, guys, please remember what I 
have in the header of every digest: "Please don't send us anything you 
wouldn't email to your friendly neighborhood narc, OK?" Sure, this guy has 
an explanation for why he is trying to crack into this box, but if he is 
fibbing, anyone who helps him would be in danger of being charged as an 
accessory to crime.

I have been working on a Win NT box of an ISP (he's a good friend and we 
have a bet going about his security) Dinner and drinks are on the line 
here.. I have to leave a sort of "calling card" w/ no trace on the Root 
of his net server.. It's an icon of a villain cartoon character..  The 
problem that I am having is that doing a port scan on the Pop3 side I 
turn up nothing of importance (only four ports available) They are 
listed below. 
 domain on port 53 
     ftp on port 21 
     pop3 on port 110 
     smtp on port 25

I also tried the obvious Netscape bug and, this is his humor Received a 
404 keyboard error saying the files requested are being held hostage by 
elves w/ a pic of him grinning ear to ear and also asking if you 
mistyped something.. I realized from then that this would be no simple 
task and that all the ordinary NT bugs would be fixed, except for the 
ping and syn flood.. Which would not be a challenge. Now on the next 
server listed via Whois I ran a port scan and found these..

daytime on port 13 
     discard on port 9 
     domain on port 53 
     echo on port 7 
     exec on port 512 
     finger on port 79 
     ftp on port 21 
     login on port 513 
     shell on port 514 
     smtp on port 25 
     spooler on port 515 
     sunrpc on port 111 
     telnet on port 23 
     time on port 37 
     uucp on port 540-- 
  
What direction should I head in next? and also to try and keep in 
stealth mode would it be advised to look in the way of finding routers 
and telenetting to various accounts? One other note is that I Ftp'd to 
what seemed to be a sort of virtual drive for clients to dload shareware 
progs.. I was able to copy the ls, would this help in any way? Any 
information that you could give me would be greatly appreciated

  Thanks in advance..

P.S. I hope that he is not a subscriber to this.. :)

Moderator: Here's another one I figured I'd better make anonymous:

I got into a system running Unix System V.The victims password was the same 
as his username, is this stupid or what? So I went to the /etc directory and 
tried the "cat" command: 
cat - views the inside of a file.

But I was given a message something like "Permission Denied" 
SH**. 
Could this be that the victim's password is just a user right? 
What command do I give to know my rights in Unix? (in novel it's simply 
"rights"maybe, if my memory serves me right) What tricks do I do so that I 
can manipulated the passwd file? 
Thanx.

yep- that's generally what it means.  a telnet account will be idle if you 
are in one shell and telnet in as another.

i.e.:  I telnet to wiw.org (my shell) as kjamez, and want to do something 
on my box, (zyklonb.wiw.org) I telnet back to there with root.  then 
mistakenly go back to wiw as kjamez from root. yeah I think that's what 
I mean.  leaving one session of kjamez idle, and root idle as well.

or in xfree86, you may have a xterm on a different console with root 
logged in.

for the most part, there is no harm in leaving a root account idle. 
unless you are the sysadmin, and leave your office unlocked while you go 
out to lunch or something. ;)

SOCIAL ENGINEERING

From: Bernz <bernz@ix.netcom.com>

Maybe it's just me. It probably is. Remote exploits (unless you discover 
them yourself) aren't a really good way of getting into a system. They 
are fixed damn quick. I'm relatively experienced at this and I have to 
say that social engineering is the only way to absolutely get into a 
remote system. I always see that people have questions about how to get 
into systems and this aspect is continually overlooked. Sneaking in 
through a dumb security guard is just as good as sneaking in through a 
sendmail bug. People should realize that. There's a world of 
scamming/hacking that's hardly been explored.

MAC WEBSERVERS

From: Pete <pete@servtech.com>

join into all of them :-).

I heard somewhere that Macs make up 20% of the servers on the Internet, 
which is quite large considering that they have such a small market share. 
I think that Macs may be hackable in the ways that NT is, with 
denial-of-service attacks, freezing the machine, etc. Unlike Unix, the Mac 
OS is not a group-oriented OS. It is a personal setup, where once you're 
in, you're in, but it is much harder to GET in. You can't use little 
loopholes like finding unshadowed passwords from a password file you get 
off FTP. Macs don't have password files to check groups and such. So, in 
this way, the Mac is a tougher nut to crack.

I don't think that anyone will get bored with Unix, but I understand your 
point. If Apple launched a major "secure server" publicity campaign, there 
might be a lot of interest from hackers who want to prove them wrong. 
Although Apple has a disproportionate "server share," Macs are so low 
profile that they haven't brought any major hacking attention. Perhaps 
after NT gets picked over...

than not. This is not the machines normal passwd file, but a separate 
passwd file for ftp accounts only.

QUICK AND DIRTY SECURITY SCANNING

From: Warpy <Warpy@null.net>

The following could be used by users to determine whether common 
security holes/bugs, etc are present on their ISP, hence posing a threat 
to their account..

Two words: ftp and sendmail..

Wu-FTPD is an ftp server daemon which is notorious for it's various bugs 
and exploits. Too often sysadmins put off what the CERT advisory has told 
them to do, i.e. install the correct patch, and run the risk of a security 
breach.

To determine what version of wuftpd the system is running simply ftp to 
it. Then note whether it is running wuftp..

It may say something like wu-2.4(?) above the login prompt. If it does 
the system is running wu. Then do a web search for "hacking ftp", "exploits 
ftp", 
etc.. and see whether your ISP is running an exploitable version. If it is 
be sure 
to email your sysadmin and let him know.. ;)

Sendmail is another commonly exploited aspect of a system. To determine 
your ISP's version of sendmail, telnet to port 25 on your ISP and not which 
version 
it is running. It may say something like 8.6.4, or 8.7.5.. Those two versions 
mentioned are both well known for bugs/exploits which are commonly used to gain 
illicit access to system.. Do another web search for "hacking sendmail" or 
something 
similar, and check whether the system is running an exploitable version. If 
so you should, 
as always, let your sysadmin know..

CANADIAN LAW QUESTION

From: Chris <chpakova@planet.eon.net>

First off I would like to say thank you. :) Your guides are an 
incredible idea!! This has got to be the best way to educate neophytes, 
and interest young people in system operations. Thank you so much :) 
I don't know if you have ever tried to ask a question in one of the 
hacker channels on IRC, but icy silence is the common response.. 
So on to my queries.. 
1) All the laws that you refer to are of course American, but what about 
Canadian law? Would you happen to know what there is on the books re: 
international computer crime laws? Can someone be extradited<sp> for 
cracking an American system from outside the US? Any help that you could 
give me in this respect would be greatly appreciated..

FREEDOM AND PROTEST IN CYBERSPACE

From: Pete <pete@servtech.com>

>and in the spirit of a true openness, I will send to the offending 
>webmaster the URL of my "anti-website".

One of the problems/good things about the net is that people can flock to 
people who think exactly the same way they do. If some crazy right-winger 
(*are* there conservative hackers? Does anyone know?) is down at the local 
bar, he could get into a fight with some liberal. On the net, he can chill 
with millions of guys who agree with him, then build up the courage and 
spam a liberal newsgroup. The thing with the net is that you can't convince 
lunatics to see the problems with their ways. If you edit a web page, all 
you do is increase the paranoia and the hatred. Your link to an 
"anti-website" will just be flamed and erased. The anonymity of the web 
does not promote nice, thoughtful conversations between two people who 
totally disagree. There's no bouncer around to drag them out of a bar.

On the subject of kicking email bombers off their sites, you have to 
realize that Carolyn's only solution is to notify their ISP. Whereas you 
really don't have the right to say what can and can't go on the Internet, 
you have the right to raise your concerns with a sysadmin, who *does* have 
the right to control what comes out of his neck of the woods. Plus, you can 
be as selective as you want. All you're doing is notifying someone that 
material might be questionable. If you like Silicon Toad's site, you don't 
tell his provider, and there's less of a chance it will go. Because this 
isn't just taking a site off the net, but asking for a site to be removed, 
you're exercising your right to protest, and then the ISP can decide what 
should happen.

my say:

there's only one glitch though. that term "legal" is often the 
interpretation of the ruling class over the ruled. arguing on the 
"legality" and "illegality" of things is problematic, which is what 
mulder was pointing out from the start.

ethics, in my opinion,  can be completely well understood without EVER 
referring to religious figures. 
        (note; while the following may seem to stray into religious debate, 
I also don't need someone writing em and saying "Christ hater!" and then 
burning down my house or something. I have a POINT. just bear with me.) 
        History has shown over the years that religion has little or 
nothing to do with ethics. more death has been caused by those who believed 
that their god made them higher in status than others than any natural 
cause. The "new" religious right is exactly the same as the ones who called 
themselves the inquisition, only now they have better p.r. agents. Ethics 
and religion should always be separate; no god should have to reward you 
for being kind, fair, open, and loving. 
        Likewise, though the great men listed above were truly heroes and 
people I personally model my self after, is they were alive to witness the 
deification of their names and images they would turn into recluses and 
retreat form the world of men. 
        So in no way does religion enter into ethics; well, maybe it does, 
but it shouldn't. If any one religion were ultimately true, we would all 
believe in it by definition. it's truth would not be open to 
interpretation. 
        In the same way, so are people's ethics different...though most of 
us regard the newer hacker laws as complete political backwash, many 
believe they aren't strict enough. 
        The point of all this rambling was this: 
        ethics should be self evident. we need to accept the fact that to 
live peacefully and in happiness we must treat each other with respect. all 
other dogma can be kindly left in the hearts of it's followers, and all the 
more strength to those who hold faith.

Funny. Depends on who we decide the experts are. Ayn Rand? Aristotle? I 
vote for William S. Burroughs.

Moderator: In case you are unfamiliar with Will's hero, William Seward 
Burroughs has been characterized as a bookworm with strong homoerotic urges, 
a fascination with guns and crime, a tendency to consume huge quantities of 
mind-altering substances, and a natural inclination to break every rule he 
could find. He was supported by his wealthy parents most of his life, and
