 *** Port Surfing Tools 
================================================================== 
From: High Pung Chow <hpc@asu.edu>

I enjoyed your Happy Hacker publications and thought I'd share... 
In your publication you make multiple references to port surfing.  I 
myself like to use tools to do some of this for me; at www.rhino9.com 
there is an assortment of useful tools including a collection called 
ostroSoft tools that has a port and domain scanner which I've 
found useful for Wingating, checking my open ports, etc. Anyway, I 
thought you may want to look there and you seem to be somebody that's 
actually willing to take the time to be a hacker, unlike most schmucks 
that get published with their old stories and attempts to grab money off 
book deals while the hacker phenomem is still active.

 *** Trojan Horse and "Hiding" files with the null character 
=================================================================== 
From: Thomason <midas@pacbell.net>

Dear Happyhacker,

I am running Win95 and I was using mIRC. As soon as I went into 
a channel, I was set up to download something. So I did and I really 
regret it . I knew I should of not opened it but curiosity killed the 
cat.

Like I said, all the bomb does is call you a lamer and then 
installs a bunch of junk folders in the root dir. When I try to rename, 
move, and delete, a message comes up saying that it can not find that 
folder. I have tried using the deltree command on it, but no success. 
The only way that I am able to get into the folders is by using edit in 
dos. I also found two files in the root dir. They both are .lmr files. 
On of the files has nothing in it and the other has all of the names of 
the folders in it. I have tried editing that files with all of the 
names 
in it but was not able to.

I have attached a file to this email that I found on the net 
awhile ago and wonder if it could be of any help. Thanks for your 
help!

Sincerely, 
B.M.T.

REAL Hidden Directories 
DOS Trick by kM & mR.dISCO 
03/25/97 (screwing around at work)

- This is old but newbies need to know about it - 
Another Original from the HackerZ Hideout 
www.hackersclub.com/km 
====================== 
OK here is a trick that you can do with your DOS/Windows3.x and 
Windows 95 machine that works. Under Windows NT 4.0 this little trick doesn't 
work.  It only works on people who don't know DOS and the ASCII table. Use at 
your own risk!  If you're trying to hide kiddie porn from the feds and 
get busted its not our fault!

Maybe we will do another revision of this that will be more malicious 
to the end user with this hack.  I'm sure if you play with it long enough and 
read your DOS manual maybe you can guess what we are thinking.

Send us your own ideas about this trick...we will publish them here if 
they are good. 
======================

What it Does: 
This trick can be used to hide data on a computer in a directory. 
Unless you know how to change to the directory manually you won't be able to 
access it (meaning Windows File Manager and Windows Explorer can see 
it,  but can't access it).

Why it Works: 
In DOS there are 256 characters (i.e. letters, numbers and symbols 
numbered 0-255).  Look in the back of any DOS manual to find these. 
When you hold down the ALT key and type the ASCII code from the number 
pad it will print it to the screen.  For example ALT (155) is " and 
ALT (129) is |. However, ALT (255) is the NULL character (it is true 
nothingness). 
  
If you create a directory using ALT (255) as the name, it will appear 
to have no name, but...=)

NOTE: You will not have the access to the full character set unless ANSI 
is loaded. Look in your DOS book, or in WIN 95 help to do this.

How to Do It: 
Goto DOS and do these commands

C: 
cd\ 
md {hold ALT (on your numberpad only)} 255 <- this is an ASCII NULL 
Character 
cd ALT 255

and put something in there.

Limitations: 
This can only be created in DOS or a DOS window.  If you create this 
in explorer or file manager it will let you access the directory.

What the Average User Sees: 
To test it...go into windows File Manager or Explorer...you will see a 
C:\_ directory...when you double click it will say :

     " c:\_ not accessible. 
      This Folder was moved or removed"

Heheh...If you really want to be bad ATTRIB the directory +H so no one 
in DOS can see it.

Why should I use this? 
 -  This is handy for making backups of configurations and covering 
your **s.

Its a small hack...but its for newbies who need to learn even the 
littlest of things count.

 *** Dig for Windows 95 
================================================================== 
From: Mark J. Van Valkenburgh

In the Happy Hacker book, you mention that you know of no Dig program 
for Windows.  Blighty Designs' (www.blighty.com/spam/spade.html) Sam Spade 
program combines a number of useful utilities.  In addition to Dig, 
there's Ping, DNS,  Whois, IP Block, Traceroute, Finger, SMTP Verify, View Raw 
Website, and Keepalive. 
================================================================== 
 *** FreePPP 
================================================================== 
From: joby07@juno.com

Hello,

I recently found of this great srvice called FreePPP. It allows to 
access the internet for FREE. Unless you live in the 212 area code, it is a 
long distance call. Here is how you can get online.

If you have windows 95 (or PPP software) then you can use it.  You 
must have Windows Dial-up networking(you may want to print these out).

    1.    Click on My Computer on your desktop 
    2.    Click on Dial Up Networking 
    3.    click on Make New Connection 
    3.    Call the connection "FreePPP" or something similar 
    4.    Select your modem if its not already selected, then click next 
    5.    Leave the area code box blank and in the telephone # box put 
          1-212-796-1460 
    6.    Now it should exit out of what you were doing, its basically 
          set-up 
    7.    Go back into dial-up networking and you should see freeppp, 
          right click and select properties 
    8.    Click on the Server Types tab 
    9.    Click the TCP/IP Settings button 
    10.   In the second section of the window, click the radio button 
that says "Specify name sever and address" 
    11.   In the primary DNS box put 198.70.60.2 
          In the secondary DNS box put 207.171.208.10 
    12.   You are now setup!

To add freeppp to your desktop:

    1. Open up dial-up networking 
    2. Right-click on freeppp and HOLD (do not let go) 
    3. Drag the icon onto the desktop and let go 
    4. From the menu, select Create Shortcut 
    5. Move the icon to where you want it.

To log-on to freeppp

    1. Double-click on icon 
    2. In the username enter ppp 
    3. As the password enter ppp 
    4. Check the box next to Save Password 
    5. Press Connect.

Please note that unless you live in the 212 area code the 
phone call will be long distance.  After you connect run your 
browser(opera,netscape, internet explorer, lynx, etc). 
Then you can browse the web as usual. When you want to disconnect just 
look in your system tray(next to the clock) and you'll see two computers 
with green flashing lights.  Right click on it and select "Disconnect".

Good Luck!

P.S: Are there any more of these services? So far, I have only found 
one.

 *** More on Free Shells 
================================================================== 
From: Jeff Gazdacko <arrow@ibm.net>

Hi Carolyn,

First, I'd like to thank you for helping me figure out how to do 
different things in Windoze 95 on the network at school (I don't use 95 at home, 
I mainly use OS/2) through this list and the GTMHH.  Keep up the good 
work! 
It would also be nice to see more about Netware and OS/2 in GTMHH's 
and on this list in the future.

Second, it seems that people are always trying to find ways to get 
free unix shell acounts.  I've found a way that I don't think anyone has 
mentioned yet, joining a Linux Users Group (LUG) near you.  The Linux 
Documentation 
Project has some links to help you find one near you 
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/).

I'm not sure if other LUG's give out shell acounts, but the one that 
I'm a member of does.  The LUG I'm in just put 2 machines on the internet 
(it's supported by an ISP), one being a Sparcstation, to use to try 
different things out in Linux.  I'm the sys-admin-in-training for the systems. 
Not only did I get accounts on both of the machines right away (everyone 
else in the LUG had to wait another month to sign a waiver and then another 
couple weeks to get their accounts created and for us to make sure the 
machines are setup right), but I'm also learning a lot about how to be 
a sys-admin and a lot about unix in general.

So, if you want to learn unix, join a LUG near you.  Even if the LUG 
that's closest to you doesn't offer free acounts, you could still learn a lot 
about unix.

Bye

Caroyln, Carolyn, Carolyn...

As you *should* know, shell accounts DO NOT cost a lot to offer...  ONE 
computer is needed to host the shell accounts.  ONE internet connection is 
needed to connect the box.  _*NO*_  Tech support is needed whatsoever! 
 Why in the **** would one need tech support on a free shell?

The only thing I can see that would cost money would be the internet 
connection, although from how it sounds, your pals at rt-66 internet 
might give you a hand..  Needless to say, you wouldn't need to place it on a 
T1 line..

The *REAL* issue I see is that you are scared of giving out free shells, 
namely becuase some people don't know how to handle them..  I think 
that this should not be too big of an issue though, assuming your 505 gang 
really knows how to get a computer set up securely.  For monitoring users, 
it would 
be wise to enstate filters and such to help you pinpoint users with harmful 
intent.

The point of this message still remains to be that cost IS NOT the 
deciding factor..  I offer shells for free on my Linux box and it costs nothing 
to me over what I pay per month for ISP access...

Sorry for the length of this message.

From: VM370x@aol.com

i think your readers may be interested in this url:

http://mk.netmegs.com/free.html

it has a big list of providers that offer free shell accounts. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
From: Liche <liche@tp.silkera.net>

Excerpt from your last Happy Hacker Digest:

[Carolyn: We don't give free shell accounts because no one has 
volunteered to pay for them.  They cost losts of money to offer -- the 
cost of the computers, the Internet connection and the tech support.]

---End of Excerpt

Since so many Happy Hacker Digest readers have supported your book by 
going out and buying copies for both themselves and friends and family, 
why don't YOU volunteer that so we can all enjoy the vast amount of 
knowledge in the guides?  Besides, doing so will make you more popular 
and it'll be easier to market more seemingly elite books to more 
unwitting newbies.  Isn't that a great idea?

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
From: Sean Duckett <metis@webFreaks.net>

You published an email in the last HH digest about free shell 
accounts.  I would like to offer a few corrections to the list.

1.  cyberspace.org DOES in fact allow acces to the shell, you just 
have to exit the menu subsystem. (I have an account there)

2.  arbornet.org also offers a free shell account.  It is similar to the 
    one at cyberspace.org; you have to exit the menu subsystem to get to 
    the shell.  (I also have an account there)

3.  it's webfreaks.com, not webfreaks.org.  Their shell accounts are by 
    far the best I have found yet ;) (see above email address...)

I would be happy to offer time for support if HappyHacker.org were to 
offer shell accounts.  You could probably get a corporate sponsor 
(perhaps techbroker.com?) to pay for the equipment needed for the shells.

--sean duckett

[Carolyn: Techbroker is my company, and we are already stretched quite 
thin with all the other things we are offering free -- the HH Digest, 
GTMHHs and Hacker Wargame.  If anyone wants to provide free shells, however, we 
will be happy to let our 10,000 readers know about it.]

 *** Fun with Prompts 
================================================================== 
From: MadMan <madman593@yahoo.com>

Here's something cool that you can do with that boring DOS prompt. 
Here's what happens when you type "prompt/?" at the DOS prompt. 
--------------------------------------------------- 
C:\>prompt /? 
Changes the Windows command prompt.

PROMPT [text]

  text    Specifies a new command prompt.

Prompt can be made up of normal characters and the following special 
codes

  $Q   = (equal sign) 
  $$   $ (dollar sign) 
  $T   Current time 
  $D   Current date 
  $P   Current drive and path 
  $V   Windows version number 
  $N   Current drive 
  $G   > (greater-than sign) 
  $L   < (less-than sign) 
  $B   | (pipe) 
  $H   Backspace (erases previous character) 
  $E   Escape code (ASCII code 27) 
  $_   Carriage return and linefeed

Type PROMPT without parameters to reset the prompt to the default 
setting. 
--------------------------------------------------- 
As you can see, you have just been given a bunch of commands that 
enable you to customize your DOS prompt.  Combine the commands with a 
little imagination and who's what you'll come up with.

Try typing this at the DOS prompt:  "PROMPT THE 
TIME$Q$T$H$H$H$H$H$H$_$P$G"  (Without the quotation marks of course.)

 *** Using Win95's FTP program 
================================================================= 
Win95 ships with a command-line FTP (File Transfer Protocol) 
program that is actually quite easy to use.  No, it doesn't 
come with nice fancy GUI, and it doesn't have bells and whistles 
like status bars and point-and-click buttons, but it is really 
simple and powerful, IF you know how to use it.  I say "simple 
and powerful" b/c it's modelled after the original Unix FTP 
program.

** What is it? ** 
** FTP commands ** 
** How to use FTP **

** What is it? **

First, what is FTP?  The file transfer protocol is a way for a 
client application to "speak" to a server, or daemon, in order 
to facilitate the moving of files about networks such as the 
Internet.  In order to distinguish this protocol from others, 
both the client and server programs are refered to as FTP 
programs.  In short, "FTP" usually refers to the client program.

** FTP commands **

Let's take a look at some of the commands that are available via 
the FTP program.  In order to view these commands and what they 
do, you need to open a DOS prompt and type:

c:\>ftp

You will now see an ftp prompt:

ftp>

To get a listing of commands, type:

ftp> help

************************************************************** 
NEWBIE NOTE:  Typing all of these commands at once at the command- 
line will cause the FTP program to try to connect to the server. 
For example, typing:

c:\>ftp help

will cause the program to try to connect to the server "help". 
**************************************************************

After typing the help command, you will see a list of commands:

!       delete          literal         prompt          send 
?       debug           ls              put             status 
append  dir             mdelete         pwd             trace 
ascii   disconnect      mdir            quit            type 
bell    get             mget            quote           user 
binary  glob            mkdir           recv            verbose 
bye     hash            mls             remotehelp 
cd      help            mput            rename 
close   lcd             open            rmdir

Wow!  That's a lot of commands.  To see what a specific command 
does, type:

ftp> help [command]

For example:

ftp> help lcd

returns:

lcd     Change local working directory

A brief overview is in order.  You see that some of the commands 
are similiar, such as "get" and "mget".  The "m" prepended to the 
command refers to "many" and the command will be executed on multiple 
commands.  For example, if you want to get a single file, you would 
type:

ftp> get myfile.txt

If you want to get all of the executable files in a directory, you 
would type:

ftp> mget *.exe

"lcd" allows you to change the local working directory (in case you 
are running the ftp command from the root, or c:\, directory, and you 
want to work with files in the \temp directory), and "cd" allows you 
to change directories on the remote machine.

"bye", "close", "quit", and "disconnect" give you different methods of 
terminating ftp sessions.

"ascii" and "binary" are transfer modes...best to use binary.

"ls" and "dir" allow you to view the contents of directories.

** How to use FTP **

So let's say that you want to update your own personal web pages 
that you maintain on your ISP.  In order to do so, you need to 
transfer, or ftp, your updated pages from your home computer to 
the server.  So you open a DOS command window, and type:

c:\>ftp myserver.com

************************************************************* 
NEWBIE NOTE:  Another way to connect to the server is to type

c:\>ftp 
ftp> open myserver.com 
*************************************************************

The response you see will be the FTP banner followed by a username 
prompt.  In order to access your account on the server, you need to 
provide your username, and then your password when prompted for 
it.

************************************************************ 
ANONYMOUS FTP:  There is something called "anonymous ftp", which 
is really nothing more than an open ftp directory that allows 
anyone access.  When presented with the username prompt, you enter 
"anonymous", and then when prompted for the password, you are asked 
to enter your email address (though just about any garbage will 
do).  You can also access anonymous ftp via your browser by typing:

ftp://ftp.myserver.com

or just:

ftp.myserver.com

into the location bar of your browser.  Keep in mind, a properly 
secured anonymous ftp server will only allow limited access...you 
will be limited to where you can go in the directory structure. 
************************************************************

************************************************************ 
EVIL GENIUS HACKING TIP:  There is an exploit floating around 
the Internet that works to some degree.  Basically, when you connect 
to an ftp server, you hit <enter> for the username and password 
prompts.  When you get the ftp prompt back, type:

ftp>quote user ftp

Hit <enter>, and type:

ftp>quote pass ftp

If this has been successful, you will be able to browse the 
directories...otherwise, you will simply have not connected.

In some cases, this exploit has allowed access to ftp servers 
that do not allow anonymous access.  Nothing regarding entries 
that appear in the server log files was reported with the 
exploit. 
************************************************************

Once you gain access to the server, you will have an ftp prompt, 
and from there you can issue the necessary commands.  For 
example, you can issue the "dir" command to list the contents of 
the directory, or you can issue the "ls -al" command, which has 
the same effect.

Since we want to update web pages, we need to change to the 
directory that the html files are kept in...generally, something 
like "public_html".  So type:

ftp> cd public_html

And then type "pwd" or "dir" to ensure that you are in the 
correct directory.  Now you are ready to copy your files 
from your computer onto the server.  If you did not start your 
ftp session from within the directory on your hard drive where 
you keep your HTML files, you can change to that directory by 
using the "lcd" command.  Once you are in the correct directory, 
and you want to update only a single file, type:

ftp> put myfile.html

If you want to update several files, you can type:

ftp> mput *.html

Once you complete your tasks, just type:

ftp> bye

Quit or exit will also work.  Disconnect will end your session 
on that server, but leave you with an FTP prompt. 
================================================================= 
 *** Disk Partitioning 
================================================================= 
From: Prata, Roger <roger.prata@tdstelecom.com>

On the LINUX CD, there is a proggie called FIPS.EXE.  There is a readme 
file with it.  Read the file, and run FIPS.  It will allow you to shrink 
your existing Windoze partition, and make drive space available to 
create a new Linux partition.

That is how I managed my very first Linux installation.  Now, I am proud 
to say, I have been M$ free for over 3 months now!  (Between a Linux box 
and a Solaris box, and a BSD box...  I have no Windows boxes at all...)

Good luck, and let me know if you need more info..
