Subj:  War gameing

I'm pretty much a newbie and I had a question.  I have a cable  
modem(Cable company)I'm hooked up to a LAN and i have win98.I was  
wondering how i can look at the other computers on the newtwork.   
I've tried everything i knew how to do, i've looked at books and i  
still can't figured it out. I might be going about it wrong, so  
could you please help?  If you could it would be graetly appreciated.

ANother question i had is how can i set a wargaming game? my friend  
has a phone modem and i have a cable modem.  Is there anything i  
need to buy or pay for? And how would I go about setting it up?

[Editor:  Generally, cable systems that I have seen have been  
shared mediums...which means that everyone shares the same physical 
medium or wire.  In this case, one would simply have to click on 
'Network Neighborhood' to see other machines.  Since you didn't  
mention _which_ company does your cable, I don't really know.  As to 
the WarGame...you're all set.  All you have to do is set up a  
machine on the Net someplace, and make sure that everyone involved 
has permission to try to 'get root'.  I say this...because more than 
one security assessment by a consultant has ended suddenly due to 
the presence of the FBI!!]

Subj:  other TROJANS!

In the latest Happy Hacker Digest, you wrote:

>Any readers want to contribute about any of the other 
>'trojans' besides NetBus and BO?  Signatures, files, default ports, 
>anything?]

Another trojan, perhaps not the most common one, is called "ICQ Trogen" 
and it's a tricky one. First: The filesize is very small (39k) so you 
won't notice if it comes together with a small file... However: It's 
not used very much and it can't really do much (get, send, execute and 
delete files). The tricky part is that you can't detect it by using 
"netstat -an" (which is far more faster than netstat -a! = UPDATE YOUR 
PERL-SCRIPT!!!) but it has a port open, and it can be detected with 
help by a port scanner. The port# is 4950. Now I come to the SPECIAL 
PART! I disassembled the executable and one strange thing I noticed is 
an unfamiliar IP hardcoded in the EXE. "206.129.11.16". What happens? 
Does the trojan send files to that IP when it's started? What is 
"206.129.11.16"? Why? I will upload the file to the web later so that 
you can do some work too. The URL will be 
http://members.xoom.com/weazel_/icqt.zip

Any comments... Ideas? Anything? By the way: I'll take a deeper look on 
BO and NetBus later (spy, SoftIce, W32DASM etc) and I'll try to dig 
deeper into the [bleep]. Anyone wanna help? Together, we can make a REAL 
trojan-hunter! ASM-coders are welcome!

[Editor:  I did some looking, and that IP is the address for a 
machine called swarm.mosquitonet.com.  Hhhmm...well, with regards 
to the Perl script...that one isn't going to be changed anytime 
soon.  Sorry.  And for future reference, please don't use any bad 
language...I [bleep]ed it this time...]

Subject:  Question

Hi, 
I was not sure which category this landed under so I sent to both of 
you. My problem has to do with my password in Netscape Navigator running 
on Windows 95. A couple months back I subscibed to an ISP and started 
using Netscape as my browser. The first couple of times I had to log my 
password but then I had it saved in the browser. Now I want to reformat 
my hard-drive(long story on that one). Stupid me I forgot what my 
password was or is(dumb isp madeup password makes no sense and 
impossible to remember). I was wondering if there was a place in 
Netscape Navigator where I could find my password. If you know of a  
way to fix this problem please e-mail me. thanks 
Geoff

[Editor:  Just a thought...but if the ISP generated it, and you 
didn't change it...did you try calling the ISP?  If anyone can 
help...email Geoff with the answer and cc: me if you would  
please...]

Subj:  Web servers for 95

I response to the reader who submitted a request for information about 
operating a web server in Windows 95...

I am not so sure about Win95, but it's probably the same,  Microsoft, 
shipped with Explorer 4.0 a little daemon called "My Personal Webserver" 
(or something to that effect). Interestingly, as a result of haphazard 
programming, occasionally, I have stumbled onto dialup users that are 
running this, (and most likely they don't know it). Funny thing, the 
server runs as a background process on a Mac, that is, it doesn't  
show up as an active process in the application menu. To boot, it can  
be set to allow web access to the entire drive(s) (Filesharing must  
be enabled)!  Wonder how many unsuspecting users out there have their  
drives wide open? [Microsoft par for the course!]

Anyways, the server is controlled from a control panel on a Macintosh 
and probably has a similar device on a Win box. Besides allowing you  
to run a little webserver, it also comes with an asp parser, so you  
can learn asp, get a job, and become a real web-geek.

For those who prefer more industrial apps, Apache has released  
v1.3.4 with a win32 build. Although it is reportedly not as stable  
as the UN*X version, it is probably fine to work with, (Apache don't  
mess around...). 
According to a site survey by Netcraft, Apache is running on 53% of  
the webservers out there, so if you're gonna mess around with  
technology, you might as well use the best ;-) --Oh yeah, I forgot  
to mention Apache is shipping with Mac OS X & it's open source, i.e.  
*free* (bet Microsoft can't even pronounce that word.)  
(For the already-web-geeks with a job, check out Apache + PHP3, 
(www.php.net; available for win32), for some real backend geeky fun!)

[Editor:  Ouch!  Quite a bit of Microsoft bashing...but I think 
the point comes across.  If you want a free web server, maybe 
you would consider Apache.  But isn't IIS free, too?  Maybe I've 
been out of the loop too long...]

Alternative Searches

Ever been looking for something and just can't find it?  Have 
you done a search and gotten a ton of links back that have had 
nothing to do with what you're searching for?  Well, Yahoo has 
always been a good place to start, because the sites are broken 
down by topic categories.  Even if you don't find exactly what 
you're looking for, you can at least get started on a site like 
Yahoo.  And now there are several alternatives.  Sure, search 
engines at AltaVista, Lycos, Excite, etc, all work great...as 
long as you use the right search string.  Well, as long as you're

Subj:  MUlinux

You might want to mention it, but a hacking newbie can a version  
of linux that can run of a disks and contains all the networking  
tools, (ping,ftp,telnet,lynx,httpd,firewall software) and also  
include  modules for sound and with an extra you can have X windows.

This version is called "MUlinux" and be downloaded @  
www4.pisoft.it/~andreoli/mulinux.html

usually cover Linux, but an alert reader sent this in, and I  
was impressed with what I saw on the web page!]

Tools You Need

One of the readers asked me to provide a list of tools that one 
would need on Windows to be a super wargaming "hacker".  If you  
and your friends are going to set up a wargame, what kind of tools 
do you need?  Hhhmmm...let's take a look at that one...

Well, the first thing I'd say you would need is a printer.  Yep, 
to get started, you want to print out all of the Happy Hacker 
Digests and Guides To (mostly) Harmless Hacking that you can  
find!!

You have a telnet client on your Windows boxen, but you might be 
more comfortable with some other version, so try looking at:

http://www.tucows.com

...for a 'terminal client', or any replacement for telnet. 
It might also help to have your favorite FTP client, too. 
Then, of course, you'll need a portscanner...Sam Spade, from 
http://www.blighty.com is my favorite.  It has a lot of other 
great utilities, as well.  Also, get netcat from:

http://www.l0pht.com/~weld

...it's indispensible.  And then I would recommend...Perl.  Yep, 
with Perl, you can tie together a lot of command line tools, 
of the kind you find on the Net and the Resource Kits.  You  
can use Perl to automate tasks, detect and respond to portscans, 
and a million other things.  It's all up to you.  Get the  
latest version of Perl from:

http://www.activestate.com

Remember, though...regardless of whether you have tons of tools, 
of you have five or six of the best tools...none of this matters 
if you have no idea what you're doing!!  The most important tool 
you can have is knowledge!  Know what you're doing.  Start a  
small 'wargame' with your friends. And as always, make sure  
that whatever box you're wargaming against, you have permission  
to do so!! 

And to find other tools:

Go to: 
http://www.softseek.com

...and look for ClickSave, and also look in the Utilities 
section.  The PCMagazine site has a lot of free utilities, 
as well:

http://www.pcmag.com

Here are some neat tools for NT:

Perl Corner

Okay, as promised, we're going to do some socket programming! 
We're going to write a couple of network client programs, so I 
hope you studied up on TCP/IP sockets.  If you didn't, there is 
some rudimentary explanation in the Perl HTML help docs that 
were installed with ActivePerl.

The Internet operates primarily on the principle of client- 
server networking.  This means that for you to connect your 
client application (telnet, ftp, web browser, etc) to a host, 
there must be the appropriate server running on that host.  So  
for all of you who are telneting around the Internet and wondering 
why you're not connecting to anything...

Many initial programming examples that I have seen have started 
out with echo or daytime clients...well, I decided to start out 
with a finger client, since you be able to easily modify the 
example for other uses.  

Before we get into the code let's briefly go over how finger 
works.  Finger is a service that lets you query information  
about a user on a system.  Now, Unix and VAX systems ship with 
a finger service ('fingerd' for Unix types), but NT and 95  
don't.  So, generally speaking, if you are able to finger  
someone, they are likely on some sort of Unix system.  The 
'well-known port' for finger is port 79...finger servers will 
(almost) always listen on port 79.  So we are going to write a  
client script that queries a finger server for information 
about a user.  We can query such users as a username, root, bin, 
or 'null' (sent as a carriage return to the system), which  
asks the server who is logged in to that system.  Finally, our  
client is going to as closely resemble a real finger client  
as possible, so we are going to have to do some parsing (ie,  
separating) of parts of a text string. 

-----  begin finger.pl  ----- 
#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exe

use IO::Socket;

# This line does some very simple checking 
# to see that the proper number of arguments 
# (ie, 1) are passed.  Admittedly, it's a  
# little messy if it exits... 
$test = shift || die usage();

# Separate the username and the host from 
# the argument string 
($user,$host) = split(/\@/,$test);

# If no username was given (ie, @domain.com) 
# then use a carriage return as the username 
$user="\n" if ($user eq "");

finger($user,$host);

################################################# 
# Send data to a port, read back all data 
# (finger) 
################################################# 
sub finger { 
  my ($user,$host) = @_; 
  print "Finger [$host]...\n"; 
  $remote = IO::Socket::INET -> new ( 
          Proto => "tcp", 
          PeerAddr => $host, 
          PeerPort => 79) || 
    die "Could not connect to $host: $!\n"; 
   
# Now that the socket is set up and connected, 
# we just need to send the username to the server. 
# That's how a finger query is done... 
  if ($user eq "\n") { 
    print $remote "\n"; 
  } 
  else { 
    print $remote "$user\n"; 
  }

# Read in data as long as the server continues to  
# send it to us...and print it out to the screen. 
# Notice that we're going to let the remote server 
# close the connection...we're not using a close() 
# method call. 
  while(<$remote>){ 
    print; 
  } 
  print "\n"; 
} 
################################################# 
# usage() 
################################################# 
sub usage { 
  print "finger.pl, by Keydet89\n"; 
  print "copyright 1999 Keydet89\n\n"; 
  print "finger.pl user\@host\n"; 
} 
-----  begin finger.pl  -----

To use this script (assuming that it's in the c:\perl  
directory), change to that directory and type:

c:\perl>perl finger.pl user@host.com

or

c:\perl>finger.pl user@host.com

NOTE:  A couple of things here.  First, you DO NOT type 
the part "c:\perl>"...that is used to indicate a command  
prompt.  Second, instead of "user@host.com", use a real user- 
name and host...this is just an example.

That's it.  You now have a working finger client for Win95/98 
systems.  Now, we could easily expand this to do checks on the 
argument string for finger forwarding...that is, sending a  
finger query through an intermediate server, and masking our 
query.  A finger forwarding query looks like:

c:\perl>finger.pl user@example1.com@example2.com

This forwards a finger query for 'user@example1.com' through 
the server at 'example2.com'.  Using the above example, feel 
free to do so.

Another interesting use of the above finger client would be to  
modify it to do expn and vrfy queries against an SMTP server. 
I'll leave that as an exercise to the curious reader...

Next time, we'll build a server.  That's right...we'll use  
Perl on Win32 to build our own finger server!  So stay  
tuned...some future topics I'm interested in are:

-- Writing a port scan detector 
-- Win32 extensions 
-- Using Win32 modules 

Please feel free to send in topics you'd like to see covered.

NOTE:  I always appreciate reader input.  If you have some code 
that you're trying to get working, then go ahead and send it in. 
Make sure you mention what platform you're using and send the  
snippet of code along...
