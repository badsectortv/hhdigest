        *** Another Win in Battle for Internet Freedom of Speech 
_______________________________________________________________________

Our thanks to Antionline.com for providing an email list server to 
manage our mailings.  It isn't easy running an email list when some of 
the world's most notorious hackers are trying to shut us down.  Hurray 
for Antionline founder John Vranesevich and Antionline and Happy Hacker 
Wargame staffer Corey Gallatin for figuring our how to keep an email 
list server running under conditions of brutal, incessant attack.  They 
are real heroes in our battle against those computer criminals (AKA 
"hacktivists") who believe they have the right to censor the Internet. 
I (Carolyn Meinel) predict that Vranesevich and Gallatin will go down in 
history alongside with other heroes of the battle for freedom of speech, 
such as Thomas Paine, Voltaire, and Benjamin Franklin.

        *** Black Helicopter Sightings 
_______________________________________________________________________

You may have noticed Antionline, John Vranesevich, Happy Hacker and 
Yours Truly (Carolyn Meinel) are often the subject of nasty stories 
originating from a number of folks who are prominent in news stories 
about hackers.  Just in case you haven't seen about how terrible we are, 
you can learn about our supposed crimes and noxious behaviors at:

http://www.attrition.org 
http://www.hackernews.com 
http://www.dis.org

People who have put in a great deal of effort trying to convince people 
that I am one or more of the following: a fraud, an FBI secret 
informant, someone who sells my body for crack cocaine (whooee!) 
include:

* Pete Shipley (according to a recent Upside magazine story he is chief 
of security for top six accounting firm Peat Marwick 
http://www.kpmg.com/; his hacker gang web site is http://www.dis.org) 
and who reportedly was questioned by the FBI in conjunction with the 
Hacking for Girliez attack on the New York Times Web site; and who runs 
the dc-stuff hacker mail list (email majordomo@dis.org with message 
"subscribe dc-stuff")

* Brian Martin, who Shipley says assists him with security projects, and 
who has been raided as a suspect in the Hacking for Girliez attack on 
the New York Times web site (Martin's hacker gang web site is 
http://www.attrition.org and his computer security company is 
http://www.repsec.org) (formerly with Trident Data Systems 
http://www.tds.com/, which serves Federal Government military and 
intelligence agencies)

* Chris Valor (Se7en), for a long time a close confidant of Pete 
Shipley, until recently a member of Shipley's Dis.org gang, and a 
sometimes roommate of Brian Martin, and who was recently exposed as a 
fraud who pretended to be a hacker when he knew nothing about hacking, 
and who tricked the media into reporting that he was running a hacking 
campaign against kiddie porn 
(http://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/17789.html)

* Michael Schiffman, recently laid off from his job with Cambridge 
Technology Partners (http://www.ctp.com/), and co-editor with Brian 
Martin of Phrack magazine (http://www.phrack.org), and who at one time 
negotiated with C-Net TV to defend the actions of the Hacking for 
Girliez gang on one of their TV programs

* Modify (real name unknown, but he tells people he is Craig Whitmore), 
who represented himself as Se7en's partner in their media hoax about 
being a team of anti-kiddie porn hacker vigilantes, and who is a member 
of Martin's gang

These four hacker media icons have something truly surprising in common. 
John Vranesevich reports (http://www.antionline.com/cgi- 
bin/News?type=antionline&date=04-19-1999&story=hhead.news):

In 1996, the self proclaimed "subversives 
expert" Fred Villella began forming a team of 
hackers through "New Dimensions 
International", a company which he is currently 
the president of. As of this year, Villella's team 
of hackers have included: Pete Shipley, Michael 
Schiffman, "Christian Valor", "Craig Whitmore", 
and Brian Martin. These individuals have 
arguably been the biggest names in the hacker 
culture, the true "head of the hacker hierarchy".

You can see these people listed as working for Villella at his web site, 
http://www.newdimensions.net.  Note Crag Whitmore is listed as 
"Modify."

For more on Villella's past involvement in penetration of suspected 
subversive organizations, see: 
http://www.publiceye.org/huntred/Hunt_For_Red_Menace-10.htm#P994_229399

To see what the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was accused of 
doing while Villella was the number three man there, see: 
http://www.sonic.net/sentinel/gvcon6.html 
http://www.livelinks.com/sumeria/politics/fema.html

Or read the book "The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis" 
by Bill D. Moyers, Henry Steele Commager.  According to this book, the 
leaders of FEMA, in conjunction with Col. Oliver North, attempted a 
military coup against the United States.  The publisher's press release 
on this book reads,

        Based on an acclaimed PBS documentary, The Secret Government 
        analyzes the threats to constitutional government posed by an 
        illegitimate network of spies, profiteers, mercenaries, ex- 
        generals and "superpatriots" who have tried, at various times, to 
        take foreign policy into their own hands.

I talked with a reporter from the New York Times about the peculiar 
coincidence that several Hacking for Girliez suspects/advocates working 
for Fred Villella.  He told me that Villella, even though he was the 
number three man at FEMA, was never more than a bureaucratic 
functionary, that contrary to news reports such as those cited above, 
Villella never took an active role in FEMA's alleged plans to track down 
hundreds of thousands of Central Americans and throw them into 
concentration camps in the event of a US invasion of Nicaragua.  He told 
me it is ridiculous to suppose that Villella and his contractors may be 
preparing plans to throw hackers into concentration camps in the event 
of a cyberwar emergency.

HOWEVER, if you want to be safe, I recommend that you unsubscribe from 
any hacker mail lists -- ESPECIALLY Shipley's dc-stuff, Schiffman's 
Phrack, and our Happy Hacker list, and resubscribe under an email 
address that is hard to trace.  Examples of free, hard to trace email 
accounts may be found at juno.com and hotmail.com.  When surfing hacker 
web sites, you may keep your identity secret by using anonymizer.com or 
try the experimental service lpwa.com.

True, you still can be tracked down if the black helicopter set is 
willing and able to set up sniffers or carry out search warrants to get 
access logs from your anonymous mail and web surfing servers.  But at 
least this way you will force the US Federal government to have to work 
hard to violate your constitutional rights.

To unsubscribe from the Happy Hacker list, email   You can resubscribe with your 
anonymous email account from our home page, http://www.happyhacker.org 
or by emailing with message "subscribe hh".

SO WHAT'S WITH THIS BLACK HELICOPTER STUFF?  If you do a Web search on 
"black helicopter" you will turn up many references to FEMA and 
"America's Secret Government."  Actually I see lots of black 
helicopters over my home, but that's just because I live near the US 
headquarters for the "Special Forces" and its black helicopters.  Read 
all about black helicopters at 
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Atlantis/8820/gvcon6.html 
http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dmckiern/blakchop.htm

Or read about black helicopters in the book: 
Black Helicopters Over America: Strikeforce for the New World Order 
by Jim Keith, 160 pages, $12.95 Order info at 
http://www.parascope.com/parastore/storeitems/blackhelicopters.htm

Actually, I'm tempted to offer expensive vacation stays at my Sandia 
Mountains home so people can view black helicopters from their choice of 
my deck, sun room or swimming pool.  Sorry, no sky views available from 
the sauna.  As long as we are going to play with conspiracy theories, we 
may as well do it for fun and profit.  Oh, yes, we have horses and 100 
square miles of wilderness for the truly adventuresome.  Now do you want 
to be my friend?:^)

I don't believe that Hacking for Girliez hit the New York Times Web site 
as a federally-funded (through Villella) retaliation for the Times 
providing downloads of the Starr report.  It probably was a coincidence 
that this happened on what was shaping up to be the busiest day in that 
Web site's history, what with all those people rushing to download the 
just-released Starr report on the Monica Lewinsky's salacious details of 
her interactions with President Clinton.  There is no way the Clinton 
administration would make the same mistake that President Nixon made 
when he hired people to burglarize the Watergate headquarters of the 
Democratic Party.

Seriously, while the Villella thing may turn out to be just a series of 
amazing coincidences, I do believe it is worthwhile to research any 
signs of a government plan to round up us hackers into concentration 
camps.  During WWII all people of Japanese ancestry were stripped of 
their property and thrown into concentration camps.  News stories claim 
that Villella's section of FEMA put in a lot of effort into tracking 
down US residents who where born in Central America, and had planned to 
throw them into concentration camps if Reagan had authorized an invasion 
of Nicaragua.

Thanks to several volunteers, we now have an in-depth dossier on 
Villella and his associates.  I would publicly credit the people who 
have been helping with this research, except that Villella is 
threatening to bring lawsuits against anyone who goes public with 
stories about him.  Anyone who does want public credit, let me know and 
you, too can hear from Mr. Black Helicopter himself!

Also, there is a possibility that some of Villella's contractors may 
commit computer crime against people who ire them, as suggested by news 
stories about Hacking for Girliez suspects who are Villella contractors. 
So don't identify yourself as having any involvement in our research 
project unless you are prepared for massive computer crime attempts.

If you would like to help us dig deeper into the Villella story, here 
are some areas where we need help.

* Have you attended any of Villella's seminars?  Who has spoken at them? 
What would you rate the technical quality of these seminars? Is he still 
using pretend hacker Se7en?

* We need true identities of members of Pete Shipley's gang or any other 
gangs that are associated with Villella.

* If you live in the Bay Area, Denver, Nashville, Northern Virginia, 
Boston region, Tampa/St.Petersburg, or San Diego areas, you might be 
able to find out amazing things about who the Federal Government is 
using in its research efforts on hackers.  Contact me and I'll tell you 
how to research people's criminal and civil court records.

I will be using this information in my upcoming book "Hacker Wars." 
Find something significant and you win an autographed copy.  If you are 
willing to face attacks by Federal contractors and computer criminals, I 
will credit you by name or handle in the book.

Again, let me emphasize that I am not making any accusations against 
Villella.  Other people, such as reporters at the New York Times, 
Washington Post, and the Nation, and a Congressional Committee headed by 
Al Gore, are the ones who made these accusations.  Villella briefly 
posted something at his web site saying that he has been exonerated of 
all accusations made by Al Gore's former Congressional Committee against 
him; that he was the victim of a vast, politically motivated conspiracy.

        *** Instructions for Sending Viruses and Trojans to Me 
_______________________________________________________________________

Lots of folks try to trick me into running Trojans or viruses by sending 
me files that they claim are something else.  Actually I welcome these 
and try to run them so I can study them.  If you REALLY want me to run 
your Trojan or virus, however, please keep in mind that I variously use 
many Unix varieties, Win95, Win98 and WinNT flavors of operating 
systems.  Since each virus or Trojan is usually only good for one 
operating system, you will make it easier for me to run your program if 
you tell me what operating system it was written for. -- CM

I wanted to comment about the Happy99.exe, the newsletter I got said it 
was sent via a stranger, well I was sent the Happy99.exe from a friend 
and I ran it thinking it wasn't a virus, and I have Norton Anti-Virus 
5.0 and it didn't detect a virus when ran, but when I updated Norton it 
found the Trojan.  I just wanted to say it is sometimes sen to you from 
people you know too.

Sincerely, 
Donny

From: "Spud" <spud@wf.net>

Hey. I just read this section in your last newsletter about Happy99.exe 
and how people keep sending them to you hoping you will run them.  Well, 
I doubt that they even know that they are sending it to you.  Do you 
know how the Happy99.exe trojan works? So they probably don't even know 
they are sending it to you. I got infected with it a long time ago, and 
I unknowingly sent it to several of my collegues before I realized what 
was going on.  I don't know if those guys that are sending you that 
stupid worm know how to get rid of it, but here is how I got rid of it: 
The file is usually named HAPPY99.EXE in the email or article 
attachment.  When being executed, the program also opens a window 
entitled "Happy New Year 1999 !!" showing a firework display to disguise 
its other actions. The program copies itself as SKA.EXE and extracts a 
DLL that it carries as SKA.DLL into WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. It also 
modifies WSOCK32.DLL in WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory and copies the original 
WSOCK32.DLL into WSOCK32.SKA.  WSOCK32.DLL handles internet-connectivity 
in Windows 95 and 98. The modification to WSOCK32.DLL allows the worm 
routine to be triggered when a connect or send activity is detected. 
When such online activity occurs, the modified code loads the worm's 
SKA.DLL. This SKA.DLL creates a new email or a new article with 
UUENCODED HAPPY99.EXE inserted into the email or article. It then sends 
this email or posts this article.  If WSOCK32.DLL is in use when the 
worm tries to modify it (i.e. a user is online), the worm adds a 
registry entry: 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce=SKA 
.EXE

The registry entry loads the worm the next time Windows start. 
Removing the worm: 
1.delete WINDOWS\SYSTEM\SKA.EXE 
2.delete WINDOWS\SYSTEM\SKA.DLL 
3.replace WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WSOCK32.DLL with WINDOWS\SYSTEM\WSOCK32.SKA 
4.delete the downloaded file, usually named HAPPY99.EXE 
NOTE: You will have to disconnect from the Internet before you can 
delete 
some of the files, or you may even have to drop to DOS.

                Thanks, 
                   Spud <spud@wf.net>

_______________________________________________________________________

From: Lee Codrington-Marshall <techwiz@freeuk.com>

Hi Carolyn, I'm sure you get loads of enthusiastic writers wanting to do 
stuff for your newsletter, but due to the exact nature you are probably 
having to turn them down a lot.  Please could you send them to 
http://www.techwiz.freeuk.com and tell them to look at the InfoZone 
section, if they want to write for my online magazine then I'd be more 
than happy to give them a place to speak.

The InfoZone is entirely run and edited by volunteers, of all ages and 
experiences, on anything to do with computers and the internet.

Thanks, 
Lee.
