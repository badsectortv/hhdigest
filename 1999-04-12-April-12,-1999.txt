Logs of the Wargame are now on display (almost) live at 
http://www.antionline.com/wargames/.  This is a first in the computer 
security industry! Shoutouts to Antionline's John Vranesevich for putting in 
the work and expense to provide this service, and thanks to the wargame 
winners (so far, heh, heh) tg0d and others who currently have root on the 
wargame for being unafraid to allow their logs to be made public.  This 
makes it easier to break in, and easier to learn how to detect break-ins in 
progress.  Happy hacking, folks!

Sorry, if you can't manage to get into any of the koan.happyhacker.org shell 
accounts, it's because that box simply can't handle all the connections that 
people want to make.  Instead, try the open root account on thirdpig.com, 
and keep a watch for easy to break into accounts that might pop up on 
meyer.happyhacker.org.

Look for a WinNT server going up on the Wargame, probably by Tuesday April 
13.  The Happy Hacksteress herself, Carolyn Meinel, is configuring the NT 
box.  So if you take it over, you get to brag that you proved she was 
"layme":):)

 *** Get a Clue!!!

We are AGAINST computer crime.  Yet we get email every day begging us to 
commit crimes.  Sheesh, even if we had no morals, why would we be willing to 
go to jail because someone emails us begging us to commit crimes?

If someone emails us bragging about his or her crimes, and her crimes are 
especially evil, we forward the incriminating email to the appropriate 
authorities.

 ***  More on AOL Hacking 
_______________________________________________________________________

From: MaleAnon@aol.com

 If you don't mind, I'd like to put my two cents worth in. The first thing 
is this. Thank you for the tip on AOL. I used to be able to do quite a bit 
of stuff from here. I could telnet, ftp, ping, tracerout, etc. etc. Then I 
thought to add another AOL account to my computer. So, needless to say, I 
put in the CD and ran the install from it. Whoa, all of a sudden I wasn't 
able to do anything. In fact, I'm pretty limited on some of the websites I 
can now visit. (Note:  I do not use AOL's browser. I minimize AOL and use 
one of the 4 different browser installed on my computer). Seems like a lot 
of sites are supposedly "not available on the server". I thought something 
was weird there. It all makes sense now after reading that little tip from 
you. Could I add one of my own? If you are installing Windows95/98 "for 
distribution with new PC" version, and it comes with AOL 4.0, please note, 
you cannot install a lesser version of AOL on your computer once AOL 4.0 is 
installed. For example: I love AOL 2.5. But there are times when I prefer 
4.0. Before I install AOL 4.0 I need to install 2.5 first. Then 3.0. Then 
4.0 last. :-)

 Now, for the second thing I'd like to comment on. This one goes out to all 
of those who were able to break into Koan.happyhacker.org. and decided to 
post a message saying things like, "This was too easy. I'm getting bored. 
This is lame. You need to make it harder" and other such comments. If you 
think it was that easy, wake up. You're breaking into the wrong box. Yes, it 
may have been easy for you, but what does that say about your hacking 
abilities? Woo hoo, you were able to break into a "beginners" box. Whoa. You 
are just too cool. Now let's just see how cool you are. Why don't you try 
breaking into a box that's not advertised as being a beginners box. The 
beginners box is easy on purpose. It's for the beginner to get the hang of 
it. If you think it was too easy, get root. Prove yourself by getting root 
and then prove yourself again by "keeping" root. Once you do that, move onto 
a harder box. Let's see how easy you think it is then. If it was too easy 
for you, don't flame the box for it. How about writing and posting something 
a little more encouraging for the newbies who are just learning? Maybe post 
something like, "Whoa, I did it. I broke in. And if a moron like me can do 
it......then so can you". 

Thank you very much, 
TheMaleMan  :-)

* Children to Learn to Quit Breaking into New York Times Web Site

WASHINGTON (March 15, 1999 4:36 p.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com)  
- A new public-private alliance to curb online crime will teach 
children "that hacking is the same as breaking and entering,"  
Attorney General Janet Reno said Monday.  
  
Educating children about acceptable online behavior is among three 
initiatives under the Cybercitizen Partnership, an initiative of 
government and the high-tech industry to promote cyberspace ethics  
and help law enforcers track down online criminals...

 *** Happy99.exe 
_______________________________________________________________________

Lots of people email Trojans and viruses such as Happy99.exe to us Happy 
Hacksters.  Do those guys think we are dumb enough to run programs sent to 
us by strangers?  They are probably the same people who keep on trying the 
PHF exploit on the Wargame and who email Meinel begging her to please commit 
crimes for them.

From: "Kern, Fred" <fred.kern@lmco.com>

I just wanted to pass along some info. I know that you have an arrangement 
with Amazon.com, but the prices out of bookpool.com are usually 
significantly better. For example the price of 52.00 for Internet Security 
Professional Reference from Amazon is 10.00 higher than bookpool's at 41.95. 
Most of the professional programmers and consultants I work with all love 
bookpool, considering we spend about 800.00 to 1,000.00 a year on books to 
keep us current.

Thanks for the good work - keep it up
