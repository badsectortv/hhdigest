1. A note from the moderator 
From: Moderator <jammer@ecst.csuchico.edu>

Hello again,

Here's another HSAD. It looks to be a good one, so I hope you like it.

You may have noticed that the period between issues has been growing. It's 
because, for the summer, I have a full-time job, which coupled with new toys 
and a healthy social life, mean I have less free time. But, not to worry. 
In two weeks, my internship's over, and I get to go back to my normal pattern 
of using the HSAD as a procrastination device.

The creation of this HSAD was stretched over 3 days due to a a very slow 
ISP whose modems kept dropping carier.

Happy Administration,

-Jon

mtools are a collection of utilities for using MS-DOS filesystems.  Word to 
the wise: just mount the partition, and use normal unix commands.  That 
way, you get to try to forget that you are dealing with crappy dos shit, 
instead of trying to fake the fucked-up dos way of doing things.

Linux would support winmodems on a fairly short basis, most likely, except 
that modem manufacturers won't let developers get technical information on 
their winmodems (I refuse the honor of capitalization to them).

============================

Please remove me from this malling-list.  I am simply fed up with the 
stupid questions that seem to pre-dominate this list.

OK, it's officially rant time. 
When I first heard of this malling-list, I immediately rushed to send a 
mail to Jon to add me (OK, I used his handy web form, and I waited a couple 
days).  I just loved the idea;  I though that I could finally get some good 
middle-level information:  I'm beyond the crap in stuff like the Linux 
Gazette (some of it isn't to simple, but lots of it is X stuff, and I don't 
use X), but reading linux-kernel gives me headaches (along with post-doc 
physics, but that's not bad from a 17yo <G>).  But of course not.  Instead, 
this digest has become a haven for "how do I configure my GUI" and people 
replying to others concerns by saying umm... I don't know.  I simply see no 
value in this digest any-more.

If a simple set of rules were adopted, I think that the quality of this 
forum would improve drastically.  So, without further ado:

[ Jon: I'm going to respond to each of the items. I think they are all valid 
       points, and I appreciate the clarity with which you voice your rant. ]

1)  Look for the answer yourself first.

[ Often people don't know where to look. One of my guides (probably the next 
  one) will be a bibliography of Linux references. But for now, the first 
  place you should look for anything is "www.linux.org". ]

2)  If the problems come before you see "Uncompressing linux....." for the 
first time (FYI:  This is the first message that you see upon boot of the 
linux kernel), then this is not the proper forum for your question; look at 
the documentation for your distribution, then their web page; then e-mail 
them.

[ Unless they're running LILO, which can encounter problems. ]

3)  If it's distribution specific, don't ask us; we won't know.  This 
includes: "how do I do this in the GUI", "how do I un-install" (unless you 
got it in source, or not as part of a distribution), and anything having to 
do with RPM.

[ That is true. There are many good forums for discussing Slack/RH/whatever 
  installations. But there are also many people on this list who know/use 
  many distributions. Feel free to ask your questions. If I feel it is not 
  appropriate, I'll let you know off list, send you to the appropriate list. ]

4)  If you don't want to run linux, don't do so.  This includes not wanting 
to exit from X and do some command-line stuff, IMHO.

[ X is a part of Linux. You aren't going to be able to run X without doing 
  command-line stuff.And yes, this is not the appropriate forum to ask about 
  getting rid of Linux. See comp.os.windows95.advocacy for that ;) ]

5)  Be certain to include any information that you think might help people 
to diagnose your problem.  This always includes your distribution.  More 
information is almost always better than not enough.

[ Very true. I get far too many questions asking "How do I get my XYZ to work", 
  with no other information. If you have a question, please take the time to 
  pose it clearly, explain the problem, and describe the situation. ]

6)  Try to speak proper English.  I have noticed that those people from 
primary US domains (.com, .edu, and .net) seem to be unable to speak proper 
English.  Perhaps you should learn the language before you worry about 
Linux.  I would certainly be ashamed to send out a mail with as bad English 
as I see all the time in this digest to a friend.  Certainly, I would not 
send such a mail out to hundreds (just how big is this list, Jon?) of 
people whom I do not know, and have it visibly archived for all time.  But 
people do that very same thing.  (Yes, I do realize that I have terrible 
run-on sentences; deal.) 
Resizing rxvt's 
=================================================================

3. Resizing rxvt's 
From: root@solfire.ludwigsburg.netsurf.de

 new subscriptions 
  every day. ]

7)  Have fun, and learn.  That's what Linux has been all about since it was 
a few kilobytes that couldn't boot without Minix backing it up that existed 
only in a dorm room in Helsinki, Finland occupied by an unknown student 
named Linux Torvalids.  (I butchered all of those proper nouns, I know...)

[ Indeed. Linux started out as a small project (read: learning experience), 
  the blossomed into a quite popular/usable tool/environment. My goal is to 
  give you (the reader) the ability to recreate that learning environment. ] 
 

OK, end rant.

Hi folks'n'hackers! ;-)

I Have a question concerning some strange 
behaviour of rxvt/bash:

The default size of my rxvt under X 
(using Linux) is 80x64 at a screen 
resolution of 1280x1024.

All works fine until I resize a 
just openend rxvt-window by clicking 
in the opper right button of rxvt.

The window grows to the full size 
of the screen and I can still enter 
commands.

But using CTRL-a or CTRL-e or 
other line editing keys the 
whole commandline, which I have 
edited before becomes confuse -- 
a lot of garbage.

Can one give a hint how to prevent 
that nasty behaviour?

rxvt: version 2.19-3 
bash: version 2.01

KEEP HACKING!

4. Mounting floopies in Linux (monkey) 
From: Duncan Mak <vulcan@asiaonline.net>

hi, 
 I install Monkey Linux on my 486 and it works really well. But I 
have problems mounting floopies (and CD) in linux? what is the exact 
command for mounting DOS FAT floppies? is it mount ext2 \mnt? (/mnt 
exists, btw) of is it mount dos /mnt?

Thankx,

--Duncan

[ Jon: The correct format is 'mount /dev/fd0 /mnt -tmsdos'. The first arg. 
  is the floppy device (usually /dev/fd0 for drive A:, and /dev/fd1 for B:). 
  The second arg. is the mount directory. The third argument is the filesystem 
  type ('msdos' in this case).  Of course, you could have found this out for 
  yourself by looking at the mount man page ('man mount'), or the Linux FAQ. ]

For example, you want to run xterm as root, but it should look like 
that jack is working there (after "w" or "who" or "finger"). 
I think that is rather not possible (of course you can always hack 
xterm sources :). 
It is possible to run xterm with "-ut" and you won't be 
logged to utmp. But I can always run eg. "ps -aux | grep bash/root" 
and find out what user is running a shell. 
 The other thing that is on my mind. What if you eg. your 
uid=500, and you euid=0. What will be shown then ?

[Jon: What's to stop you from doing it? Alas, on the machine I was going to 
      try it on, I don't have rxvt installed. ]

ps. One thing amazes me. Who is the real author of this post.

:Another linux question, 
: 
:Often i have a program to compile and gcc spits the dummy when it cant 
:find a library its lookign for.

Check if you have a library, it should be in one of directories 
listed in /etc/ld.so.conf. You can also tell programs to look for 
libraries located in any directory by: 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/the/library; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
You can do a lot of interesting things with libraries.

:lsa which executes the ff command:

:bash: lsa: command not found 
:[ Jon: I can't see your problem, but why do it that way. You can do it much 
:       easier using "alias". Do a man alias to find out more. ]

Jon is right, the best way to do such kind of things is to setup an 
alias. Sample entry in bash looks following:

alias ll='ls -l' 
alias pgrep='ps -auxw | grep $1'   /* $1 is a variable */

But you can't run lsa because it's not in your PATH. 
On Linux a local directory (a dot) is not searched 
by default. You have to add it to your PATH or tell linux 
that lsa is in you current directory. Type: ./lsa 
To check the path type: echo $PATH

[ Ah yes, I forgot about that. I have it set by default on all of my machines, 
  which makes it easier. ]

Incoming SMTP doesn't work very well with dynamic addresses.  To make it 
work, your ISP would have to do something with dynamic DNS.  I have made 
this work and it is ugly.  But there are workable options.

You have three choices for getting your mail: POP, IMAP, and UUCP.  POP 
makes sense if you just want to batch download your mail in a batch. 
popclient works well.  IMAP makes sense if you want to leave the mail on 
the ISP's server.  Pine works very nicely.  (I'm a pine fanatic.)

If you want to have more than one mail box, life gets more interesting. 
Using POP or IMAP, you'll need to have an ISP account for each mail box. 
Now, that may be fine for some.  But I find its a headache to administer. 
Its not that bad with IMAP, but if you've automated popclient to check for 
mail every once in a while, then you have to keep track of usernames, mail 
servers, and passwords for every user.  That's a pain.

Which brings us to the third solution: UUCP.  This requires the 
cooperation of some ISP out there.  (You can get UUCP service from one ISP 
and your PPP connection from another.)  You decide on some domain name 
(@blazyblah.somedomain.com) and all the mail for that domain gets sent to 
your machine via uucp.  You can add and delete users on your machine 
without worrying the ISP about it.  UUCP works fine over PPP connections 
with dynamically assigned addresses.  And UUCP over tcp/ip is a lot easier 
to administer than the old uucp on a raw modem was.

<COMMERCIAL pardon="please"> 
 I sell mail over UUCP service if your ISP does not. 
</COMMERCIAL>

[ Jon: But, if not setup properly, UUCP has some serious holes that can be 
       exploited. ]

7. Sorry to be lame 
From: PlahZma Franco <plahzma@juno.com>

I have been reading about Linux for a while now and decided to ask for 
specific advice.  I have a compaq presario 425 DX4 100Mghz,  I purchased 
a 2.1 Gig drive a while back and parted it to 2 partitions.  Due to win95 
problems I lost some space in the process. 
When I use DOS fdisk heres what i get: 
Part.      status        type            volume label          MBytes 
      system              usage 
c: 1            A           PRI DOS 
1801                FAT 16               54% 
2                              EXT DOS 
  929                                              46%

Then it asks me to display logical DOS drives on part. 2: 
DRV.     ........             MBytes          System    Usage 
D:                                  929                FAT16   100%

I want to part the d: in order to put linux on it.  But Fips says I can 
not split extended dos partitions.  So now what?  I want about 200 megs 
for linux.  What do I do from here?  How do I create the partition I 
want.  BTW if you havent figured it out yet Im running win95, I boot from 
the c: and I really want Linux.

[ Jon: Try out Partition Magic. Yes, $59 does seem like a lot of money, but 
       it works, and does its job pretty well. ]

Also, I want to buy Redhat...and Im wondering if I will be able to 
install it with my cd-rom. 
I have two cd-roms actualy one very old and one old.  I have a 1 speed 
BSR cd-rom , can I use this to install linux?  I also have an 8 speed.  I 
would prefer to use this but dont think I can since it hooks up to the 
printer port and the printer is routed to it.  I use win95 SCSI 
controllers in order to use it, and cannot use it straight under MS-DOS 
since it is initialized in win95.

[ Your best bet is with the older CD-ROM drive. Especially if it uses an 
  IDA/ATAPI interface. Otherwise, you probably have enough space to copy 
  the distribution to your HD. ]

Thank you everybody for helping me and Im very Sorry to sound so 
ignorant.

[ You can compensate for ignorance by taking the time to clearly state your 
  question, and think about the problem. If we all speak clearly, we can better 
  communicate problems and solutions. ]

8. Linux Red Hat 4.2 
From: Michael Todd <trelane@infocom.com>

I recently installed Red Hat 4.2 and with it, installed the newest version 
of XFree86 version 3.2. I'm having problems with starting X. It acts like 
it's going to start, then it brings up a terminal window, starts to bring 
up control panel and just hangs there. It's almost like the mouse is locked 
or something. I can see the mouse pointer but cannot move it. My system 
info is as following: 
P166 MMX, Asus VX97 motherboard, Matrox Mystique 4 MB video card, Sound 
Blaster 16 sound card, USR 33.6 Sportster Modem (not Winmodem) set to com2 
IRQ3 (dos), 3Com Etherlink III Network card (3C509 TPO), 32 MB RAM, 1.6 WD 
Hard Drive, Microsoft Serial Mouse, Compaq Presario 1400 Monitor. I checked 
all the settings I could find and couldn't find any problems. If anyone has 
had the same problems and knows the fix, help me please. I also have 
MetroLink X server 3.1.5 and it doesn't work either. I have deleted, 
formatted and re-installed numerous times with the same and different 
options. The version I have does work, I have it installed on my work 
computer (basically same computer except Processor(P100), Video 
Card(Diamond Stealth 3D) and monitor(IBM 15P). I even tried the Diamond 
Stealth 3D card in my machine at home, no luck. Tried different monitor 
settings....is there away to set my monitor for the exact specs? I picked 
the closest and most conservative to mine, but there were no exact 
settings. Would that cause it to lock up like that?

[ My guess is that it is the video card. Check to see that the chipset is 
  supported by the version of X you're using. www.xfree86.org should 
  contain the most recent list, plus information for your card. 
  I assume you're using XF86Setup to do the configuration. If so, you might 
  want to go and edit the X configuration file, /etc/XF86Config. Do a man 
  of XF86Config for its syntax. ]

Also, question 2..after 
my Windows 95 partition got screwed, I reinstalled Windows 95 and now LILO 
is gone on my computer at work. How can I get it back? The Linux partitions 
are still there. Just no way to get to them. The only bootdisk I have is 
the installation bootdisk.

[ Take your installation bootdisk and boot with it. When it asks you for boot 
  parameters, type "mount root=/dev/hda2 ro", using your Linux partition in 
  place of /dev/hda2. This will make it boot using your Linux partition as 
  the root partition, from which you can simply run lilo to reinstall. ]

And finally number 3. I have an earlier version 
of slackware and XFree86 version 3.12. It came with a screensaver called 
Rock which I really liked. Unfortunately, 3.2 doesn't include it. Does 
anyone know where I can get it? Keep in mind, I'm not real familiar with 
Linux and am just learning. I haven't gotten much farther than installation 
and a little bit of configuring. I don't know how to install programs in 
Linux or how to do upgrades or patches. I've been reading HSAD newsletters 
as they come out. I've got a couple of decent books but the most prevalent 
thing right now is to get X working. The other stuff will come later. I'd 
appreciate any help anyone can give me with this. Thanks.

[ Search for "xlock" on the web. The screensavers are actually bundled in one 
  app called xlock. The mode is controlled by the '-mode' parameter. Rock 
  may still be in there, but under a different name. man xlock for more info. ]

9. HSAD - hd problems 
From: -1

Hi , first off - kepp up the good work jon , your doing a fine job =) 
 

i'm having big troubles with a new quantum 6.4 eide hard drive 
i have 3 main problems , which i summize

 1) I can't  seem to enable translation of my new hard drive 
 2) The appreance of a new phantom hard drive /hdb 
 3) A new occurance of different physical/logical endings on /hda

my system is set up as follows

pro 180 , with a AMI BIOS 1.00.04 - only got this box last november

primary bus - quantum fireball eide 3.8 - master

secondary bus - 1) quantum stratus eide 6.4 - master  - NEW 
                2) cd drom - slave

all the settings in the BIOS are on auto configure 
for both drives and cd-rom , they all have the same options enabled

but i have strange messages on boot , about a non existant device 
/dev/hdb 
( all the jumpers are set correct on all drives )

Jul 22 03:29:40 iceburg kernel: hdd: FX120T, ATAPI CDROM drive

my lilo is standard with no append lines or linear lines

also as you can see the hda has been translated from 16 heads to 128 , 
and 
also with the cylinders approx 7400  to 935 ,

How do i translate my  hdc ???

i' ve tried the ontrack ,  boot manager 
but it only had options to lay a ddo to a floppy OS disk 
and i could not see any translation options either .

Any suggestion on other software  ?

On a side note , where excatley does the ddo live on the  mbr 
because i have fdisked  the /hda mbr many times  and yet the translation 
has not been aftected .

and if all this was not bad enough  fdisk for /dev/hda now reports 
 

Disk /dev/hda: 128 heads, 63 sectors, 935 cylinders

        phys=(933, 127, 63) logical=(934, 127, 63)

any ideas ?

i have searched the web extensively , real the lilo doc's , and the 
large disk 
how-to's , but yet i can find no real solution

Any help would be greatly appreaciated

Cr0n

[ Jon: One thought might be to go into your BIOS and search for a setting 
       which enabled "LBA" or large-block-addressing. Another thing to try 
       is to tell LILO the exact specifications of your hard drive. Do 
       a man on 'lilo.conf' for details on how to do this. ]

10. Submission for HSAD  HELP!! 
From: Andy <jaliviper@geocities.com>

Hi all, 
I need some seroius help. 
I have Linux 1.2.13 on my 386 machine. It has a FPU and 8mb of ram with a 
25Mb swap partition. 
Recently I've been noticing that some of the virtual terminals have been 
going haywire. tty3,tty4 and tty6 wont work and neither will tty12 . They 
dont show up in /dev and every 5 minutes i get a message saying the process 
is respawning too fast and its disabled for 5 minutes. 
X now refuses to run as it cant find tty3 , I managed to fix that by making 
a link to tty5 called tty3 ;-) The /etc/inittab file seems fine, i even 
replaced it from a backup. Some changes could have been made without my 
knowing(root is unpassworded and a lot of people use my machine) . Any ideas?

[ I don't know. You might try recreating your /dev directory. ]

Also can I upgrade just the kernel? If so will copying the new kernel and 
running Lilo do it?

[ No. But the files you will need to go along with the new kernel are listed 
  in the release notes. ]

Any help would be appreciated

10. chmod +x  and mtools 
From: noname <noname@blah.com>

<SNIP>

[ Jon: Hmm. What are the mtools? ]

I think they are a collection of short scripts that allow a user to use 
_M_S-DOS commands in Linux.  mdir a:\new  That'd get some wierd response 
in linux if it were ls a:\new  And it allows newly enlightened DOS users 
to get around for a bit.  Hopefully, this isn't a permenant arrangement.

12. setting up x-windows 
From: Manny Roque <unix70@mosquito.frcc.cccoes.edu>

i have currently linux red hat 4.1 and i'm pissed off at packard bell 
for giving a hell of a pc to configure with linux. the os is installed i 
just can't get the video to display correctly with x windows. i have a 
cirrus chip on the motherboard :( and it does display x windows it's 
just very fuzzy when i'm in x. i have the linux bible but i don't want 
to spend the day reading it, does anyone have a quick fix for this? 
and yes i do have the monitors manual with all the specs.

[ Jon: Have you tried whacking the side of the monitor ;). We need to know 
       more about your system (chipset, monitor, etc) before we can help. ]

13. Re: July 20th HSAD! 
From: Jason William RENNIE <jrennie@hardy.ocs.mq.edu.au>

Ok, so i've got the lib i want. Where do most programs expect to find 
them ?? The main problems i've had are with compiling a picture viewer i 
found. I found the jpeg lib it asked for, but where do i put it ?? 
/usr/local/lib ?? /usr/lib ?? etc. I know i could put it anywhere but 
where is the usual place ?? I assume mnost makefiles expect to find them 
in a certian place.

I hope that clarifies my query.

Jason

[ Jon: Usually, it is specified in the library documentation. Also, look for 
       some kind of "make install" when compiling the library (you ARE 
       compiling them yourself, right?) ]

14. Minicom installation troubles 
From: "Kurt Pfister" <kpfister@ao.net>

I am running Monkey Linux on a 486 box with 32 MB ram and am trying to 
install an ELF distribution of minicom.  The problem is that none of the 
executables included in the program will work, the computer tells me that 
the command is 'not found', even when I can see it in an ls.  The 
permissions all have 'x' in the appropriate places. 
The installation script did not work either, so I moved all of the files to 
the appropriate directories by hand.  Any Ideas?  Thanks in advance.

[ Jon: As mentioned above, is your path set correctly? Is the minicom binary 
       located somewhere in your path. Also, does your kernel support ELF 
       binaries? If not, rebuild it so that it does. ]

15. help 
From: HeX <hex@netnet.net>

I recently got red hat's linux 4.1 for intel and when I tried to install it 
I found a problem. linux will install fine but lilo will not install onto my 
machine. I have win95 but that can't be the problem cause the last time I 
tried to install linux I formated my hd first and started with linux and it 
still would not install lilo. the only thing I can think of is that I have a 
bad install cd. red hat tech support gave me the run around, answers lilo 
not loading, which has nothing to do with lilo not installing from the 
install cd. I can't alter a program that doesn't exist on my computer yet. 
and after they gave me the run around till the warrenty ran out for tech 
support they cut me from their system. so my only chance is if someone out 
there can help me. I'm not a linux god as a matter of fact I was just 
learning linux but I can't get on with my study until I can actually use 
linux and was gonna use this version to learn from. If anyone can help or 
can confirm my theory that the install cd red hat sent me is faulty I would 
appreciate it, thanks..

[ Jon: What does lilo (not) do? Does it give an error? Does it not boot? 
       I am very hesitant to blame RedHat. Give us some more information about 
       your system and we may be able to help. ]
