Special Windows NT Hacking Resources Issue 
======================================================================

   With the wildfire spread of the Windows NT operating system, and 
   its growing use for Internet and Web servers, NT is becoming THE 
   operating system that hackers love to hack.  To keep up with the 
   growing list of NT exploits, there are several excellent email 
   lists you may wish to join. Following are three of the best.

*** Microsoft scrambles to close loopholes in software and image 
======================================================================

    In the last week three students at three American universities 
    dis- covered three serious security loopholes in Microsoft 
    Internet and desktop software, and, after contacting Microsoft, 
    published three similar Web pages to spread the word and to cement 
    credit for their finds. In each case the bug was discovered by a 
    single student, who then enlisted friends to investigate it and 
    publish the findings.

          Discov-   Date    School  MSIE    Win95?   WinNT?

          Rioux

    Microsoft now has a patch [9] available for download that fixes 
    all three bugs.

    The WPI bug [6] (also called Cybersnot, after the domain name at 
    which it was published) exploits the surprising fact that a remote 
    machine can directly access and run Windows "Shortcuts" -- .LNK or 
    .URL files. This bug is the most widely dangerous of the three. 
    The second bug [7], called UMD, as demonstrated requires the user 
    to double-click on an icon imbedded in a Web page; this action can 
    run a program on the client machine. Machines in networks behind 
    fire- walls are not vulnerable, so the bug affects far fewer 
    machines than the original one. The MIT bug [8] uses .ISP files, 
    yet another flavor of automatically executable objects in the 
    Microsoft environment, this one intended to help users sign up for 
    Internet service. (Per- haps characteristicly, the MIT page sniffs 
    at the weak "exploit" examples developed by UMD.)

    When Microsoft first posted a patch to the WPI bug, an Israeli 
    com- puter security / antivirus company, EliaShim, saw an 
    opportunity to add value (and get lots of publicity and names for 
    their database).  The effect of the Microsoft patch is to warn the 
    user if s/he is about to download a Shortcut. EliaShim has posted 
    a stronger patch that unilaterally prevents the download of a 
    Shortcut. (You can download the patch, called IE-SAFE, here [10] 
    -- but note that Elia- Shim collects contact information from you 
    before letting you down- load, a move I consider borderline 
    sleazy.) EliaShim claims that the bug affects not only IE, but 
    also Microsoft's Internet Mail and Internet News applications 
    running on Win 95 and Win NT, a claim which Microsoft doesn't 
    quite deny.

    A blizzard of news coverage followed the first bug's announcement: 
    by the morning of 3/4 the story had spread from seven Net news 
    organizations to page 1 of the New York Times, above the fold. 
    Coverage has tailed off rapidly with the drumbeat of new discov- 
    eries; the news value of "more of the same" has a perilously short 
    half-life. This is a shame, because the real story is in the pat- 
    tern. As the UMD discoverer David Ross noted, these bugs all 
    result from the expedited push to integrate the Internet Explorer 
    with the traditional Microsoft desktop. The desktop was designed 
    to be private. Networks aren't private.

*** Linus moves ten time zones west 
======================================================================

    Or is that fourteen east? Linus Tovalds, the creator of Linux, has 
    left his native Finland for Santa Clara, CA, where he will join a 
    start-up chip design company called Transmeta. (They have a domain 
    name but not yet a Web page.)

*** Windows NT BugTraq Mailing List Announcement 
======================================================================

   In the tradition of Aleph One's BugTraq mailing list, this list has 
   been created to invite the free and open discussion of Windows NT 
   Security Exploits/Bugs or *SEBs* as I call them. This list is not 
   intended to be a forum to discuss "how to" issues, but instead 
   should be used to report reproducible SEBs which you have 
   personally encountered with Windows NT or its related BackOffice 
   products.

   Q:What is a SEB? 
   A:Anything that can be done to a Windows NT installation via a 
   remote connection (network or RAS) or through the local 
   installation of commercial software which causes Windows NT to 
   react in anything but an expected fashion. So telnet to TCP port 
   135 and typing 15 characters thereby causing the Windows NT CPU to 
   go to 100% utilization would be an acceptable topic. Sitting at a 
   console logged in as Administrator and removing the 
   Administrator's file permissions on the %systemroot%\system32 
   would not be considered an acceptable topic.

   Do's: 
   - Discuss SEB resolution or workaround. 
   - Discuss SEBs in third-party Windows NT products, providing that 
     the product is designed for BackOffice. 
   - Discuss Macintosh, Netware, or Samba/Unix-related SEBs assuming 
     that the SEB is related to Windows NT involvement.

   Don'ts: 
   - Discuss Windows '95, unless, and only if, the Windows NT SEB can 
     only be reproduced with a Windows '95 client. 
   - Discuss Windows for Workgroups or Windows 3.x, for any reason. 
   - Discuss products to enhance security, unless they have been 
     proven to resolve an outstanding SEB. 
   - Discuss Unix SEBs, these should be addressed to 
     BUGTRAQ@NETSPACE.ORG (subscribe through LISTSERV@NETSPACE.ORG) 
   - Discuss general Windows NT Security, how to, what to, why to, 
     type questions. The NTSecurity@ISS.net list (subscribe through 
     MAJORDOMO@ISS.NET) would be a better forum to discuss these 
     issues.

   Vendor involvement in the list is not discouraged, but I would ask 
   that you not use this forum as a method of advertising the value of 
   your products. If a SEB shows a weakness in Windows NT design, and 
   your product can resolve that weakness, a short note indicating 
   TECHNICALLY how your product addresses the issue would be consider 
   appropriate. If you don't address the issue in a technical fashion 
   your subscription will be revoked.

   Now after reading all of this you'll probably wonder why I'm being 
   so restrictive. For one, I want to keep the volume low, as low as 
   possible.  I want to keep the content as pertinent as I possibly 
   can so that the list becomes a useful tool for everyone using 
   Windows NT. If the list can remain on topic, people will post SEBs 
   here first, and we will all have an opportunity to address the 
   issues in a way best suited to our environments.

   I would also make a couple of recommendations to you prior to you 
   posting a security exploit/bug.

   1. Don't post SEBs unless you have been able to reproduce it. If 
   the subscriber base grows as I expect it will, posting such 
   messages may cause many people to waste valuable time trying to 
   reproduce something which is not there.

   2. When posting a SEB, make sure you include enough relevant 
   information about your configuration to make it possible to 
   reproduce your scenario.  Versions of the relevant software, 
   service pack levels of your system, platform, and any configuration 
   information which might affect the issue. By doing this you will 
   prevent a lot of messages asking you the basic questions and make 
   resolution or workaround that much quicker.

   3. When posting a resolution or workaround, if you have received a 
   Microsoft Knowledgebase Article number (a Q#####), please post it 
   with your message so everyone can read it if they want.

   4. Remember your Non-Disclosure Agreements. Issues pertaining to 
   products covered under NDA should not be discussed here, use the 
   appropriate Microsoft Newsgroup for these issues. Typically, once a 
   product has been released to public beta testing your NDA changes 
   to one limiting you from discussing performance characteristics of 
   the product.  Please check with your Microsoft representative or 
   Beta Administration if you are at all unsure of your NDA status 
   prior to posting.

   This list operates on a confirmation basis. Your subscription, and 
   every message you post to this list will generate a confirmation 
   message from LISTSERV@RC.ON.CA. This is there for your protection 
   to ensure that subscription requests really are from the actual 
   individual email address. It is also there to let you think about 
   your message prior to it being posted. This is not a configurable 
   option.

   I hope that the list proves useful to you and your organization. 
   With the REview option turned off, I hope that it will attract 
   individuals in organizations who have the ability to address the 
   issues which get raised on this list. I know from personal 
   experience that having to pay Microsoft US$195 in order to report a 
   bug (despite the fact you get a refund 3 or 4 days later) can often 
   mean the difference between reporting a bug and not. This list 
   should provide an alternative to that process, and at the same 
   time, should allow the rest of the Windows NT community the 
   opportunity both to take up the issue with their own Microsoft 
   representatives, and protect themselves from the possible exploits 
   which a SEB might expose them to.

   The objective is to get SEB resolution done faster, better, and 
   with less risk to the Windows NT customer than currently exists.
