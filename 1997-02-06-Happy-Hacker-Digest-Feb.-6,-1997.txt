Moderator: I may live to regret adding a Latin slogan (the orbem rigidum 
thingy above) to the Happy Hacker Digest boilerplate. Check out all the 
Latin slogans in the posts below. Do we see a trend shaping up here? Will we 
add Latin to C++ and Perl as must-learn languages for the elite hacker?

LEGAL ISSUES

From: SS Rat <reidy@tis.com> 
Subject: Re: Happy Hacker Digest Feb. 5, 1997

Here's a good URL to keep up on the laws pertaining to hacking, cracking, etc.

http://www.gahtan.com/techlaw/

It's important to know the law if you want to hack legally. Remember 
ignorance is not a legal defense!

Subject: Please make anonymous

Two quick questions: 
1)Is IP spoofing and sniffing illegal??? 
2)does anyone know of any bugs in wwwboard.pl, cause I've seen two of 
them hacked in the past week?

Does anyone know of the laws regarding international hacking?  For example, 
if I sat here in Blighty (Britain) and hacked a US computer, and left a 
message on there with my name, address, 
telephone number, date of birth, national insurance (social sec.) number, 
bank account details... what the hell could they do about it?  Also, what if 
I did it from Mongolia or a remote link in the middle of the Pacific Ocean 
in a rubber dinghy?  I'd be interested to know.

A consultant friend of mine, Joel Snyder, did a lot of work with the

platforms).  You may be interested in what he's done.  His address is 
jms@opus1.com.  The PMDF product includes some measures to prevent being 
used as a relay, as well, but isn't as robust as Joel's work.  Information

Subject: Electronic Funds Transfer without stealing PIN/TAN

The Berlin newspaper "Tagespiegel" reports on 29 Jan 97 about a television 
show broadcast the previous evening on which hackers from the Chaos Computer 
Club demonstrated how to electronically transfer funds without needing a PIN 
(Personal Identification Number) or TAN (Transaction Number).

Apparently it suffices for the victim to visit a site which downloads an 
ActiveX application, which automatically starts and checks to see if 
Quicken, a popular financial software package that also offers electronic 
funds transfer, is on the machine. If so, Quicken is given a transfer order 
which is saved by Quicken in its pile of pending transfer orders. The next 
time the victim sends off the pending transfer orders to the bank (and 
enters in a valid PIN and TAN for that!)  all the orders (= 1 transaction) 
are executed -> money is transferred without the victim noticing!

The newspaper quotes various officials at Microsoft et al expressing 
disbelief/outrage/"we're working on it". We discussed this briefly in class 
looking for a way to avoid the problem. Demanding a TAN for each transfer is 
not a solution, for one, the banks only send you 50 at a time, and many 
small companies pay their bills in bunches. Having to enter a TAN for each 
transaction would be quite time-consuming. Our only solution would be to 
forbid browsers from executing any ActiveX component without express 
authorization, but that rather circumvents part of what ActiveX is intended 
for.

A small consolation: the transfer is trackable, that is, it can be 
determined at the bank to which account the money went. Some banks even 
include this information on the statement, but who checks every entry on 
their statements...

I've been using the World Wide Web for a while now and was wondering if 
there is a way to force the browser you're using to retrieve a list of 
documents in the directory on the server, rather than something like 
index.html or default.html . It's stumped me for a while and wondered if 
anyone else out there had been able to figure this out.

Hello, I would first like to say that HH rocks! Now you say in your post 
all the time about hacking web pages? I have a friend who always can get 
into my page and put little drawings on my picture lol. How dose he do these 
he lives 2000 miles away and he is on a different ISP? I would love to give 
him a dose of his own medicine. I am running windows 95 and so is he my 
server runs some sort of Linux version.

Any help would be most grateful.

(Moderator: First, try changing the password you use when you download 
modifications of your Web page. How does your Web page server accept 
passwords? If you have to transmit them in the clear, your friend may be 
sniffing passwords. Or he may be finding other ways to break in -- 
possibilities are endless.)

Subject: Netscape

If you want to get rid of the annoying list of recently visited URLs in 
Netscape, then do this.

Open Netscape.ini in Notepad.  Find the mention of the URL's.  Delete the 
ones you don't want.  The remaining ones must have the number in the prefix 
consecutive, so you need to change those.  Now save the changes, and you 
are done.

It is a good idea to set INI files to open directly into notepad, as power 
users will regularly need to edit them.

WIN95 HACKING

From: David Nevas <dan2@Lehigh.EDU> 
Subject: win95

I am currently at a campus network, and each of the dorms on campus has 
a sub-network. We have our dorm set-up using Windows 95 file and print 
sharing so whoever wants can make their computer available for others to 
download or run programs on (only in certain directories, of course.) 
What happened though, was that one student, who was very new to 
computing, set up his computer so that everyone had access to ALL of his 
directories, without needing a password. A certain somebody else decided 
to go in and delete the entire contents of this students computer, 
causing an incredible amount of grief to the other student who's 
computer suddenly wouldn't even boot up. Now, we all know who this kid 
is, and what I am wondering is, are there any security holes that you 
can use to get past the Windows 95 password prompt (unfortunately, just 
hitting escape doesn't do the trick...) to connect to other computers? 
I'm not suggesting that I would do anything harmful to this other 
persons computer, just change their autoexec.bat and wallpaper to leave 
them a little message to tell them what will happen next time they 
decide to wipe out someone else's computer. Thanx a lot, and great job on 
the Guide.

Carolyn, 
 Thanks for the help, but I think you misunderstood me. I'm not talking 
about the password prompt when Win95 first boots up. When you try to 
access someone else's computer through Network Neighborhood, you get a 
prompt for a password to access that person's computer. That is what I 
am wondering how to get around. I do not have physical access to his 
computer either, so the boot disk option is gone. Thanks again.

Win95 is soooo easy to 'hack'.

If you want to see another users desktop, start-menu and recent folder, 
then just do this:

Go into your Windows Directory. 
Go into Profiles 
Go into the User Name of you choice.

There you are.  Easy or what!?  Sadly though, slightly useless.

If you want their password, then just put a Keystroke logger in the 
Autoexec.bat, or THEIR start folder (in form of shortcut).  I don't tend to 
do this, because I know certain other tricks that allow me to 'become' 
another user (he, he...), which I'm not going to tell!

PS.  I've got this useful program for hiding sensitive files (Accounts....). 
 It's called Magic Folders, and is brilliant.  Try to find it on the web. 
It shall be on my website (which is to open at the beginning or March), and 
I'll mail you the URL when I know what it will be.

Subject: Quick MSIE Hack! --N-TREEG

Greets to Carolyn and everyone on Happy Hacker.

At my University's Library, they have win95 boxes connected to the Internet 
for web browsing.  The TaskBar is set up so that you supposedly can only 
access the applications they want you to have access to.  The task bar gives 
no file manager access or MS-DOS prompts.  Also, there is no "My Computer" 
icon to play around with.  The computers are running Microsoft Internet 
Explorer.  This makes it trivial to view and access any file on the 
machine's hard drive.  Just enter the following in the URL: 
file:///C| 
This opens windows to any folders the machine may have.  No need for file 
manager access.  News Flash to the library:  Limiting options on the task 
bar does not keep files from prying eyes and should not be considered for 
any type of "security" ;)

Yeah, I know this is a lame hack but its something to keep me 
procrastinating (don't feel like writing my paper for class at the moment!)

Peace...

X.25 HACKING

Although I've been enjoying your (Karen) guides to harmless hacking for a 
while, I subscribed to the list only a few days ago. It seems like a good 
forum, without spam and posers. 
Why not do something about X.25 networks some time? DataPak intrigues me. 
For those interested in BBS hacking, there are some tips in two files on 
anarchy-online.com (telnet BBS), the files are called UNDRGRND.ZIP and 
UNDER2.ZIP. 
Some guy called root said he only saw less on Linux, but I've run it on 
Amigas many times. =) 
Last of all, Strider might not know that he uses a name taken by the

At home I've got a little network ( 4 computers / Class C 
192.168.001.??? / TCP/IP protocol ) . 1 computer ( the one with a 
modem ) runs Linux . Now my question : Is it possible to use the Linux 
PC as a kind of router for the other computers ( running wfw311 & TCP/IP 
protocol ) . At the moment the only way to access the Internet from the 
3 WfW311 PCs is telnetting to my Linux PC :-( . It would be cool if 
someone could tell me how I can setup some kind of a router ( or should I 
install a proxy ??? or should I install Linux on the other PCs too ??? 
or what ?? ) so that I can use Netscape Navigator or an other Browser 
which runs under WfW . I already sent this question to some newsgroups - 
no response . Possibly they are not 313373 enough - that's why I send 
this question to HH .

On to hacking the password... if you copy this file to your computer and 
open it, you'll get something like this one I found somewhere (can't 
remember for the life of me where): 
 root:x:0:1:0000-Admin(0000):/:/sbin/sh 
 daemon:x:1:1:0000-Admin(0000):/: 
 bin:x:2:2:0000-Admin(0000):/usr/bin: 
 sys:x:3:3:0000-Admin(0000):/: 
 adm:x:4:4:0000-Admin(0000):/var/adm: 
 lp:x:71:8:0000-lp(0000):/usr/spool/lp: 
 smtp:x:0:0:mail daemon user:/: 
 uucp:x:5:5:0000-uucp(0000):/usr/lib/uucp: 
 nuucp:x:9:9:0000-uucp(0000):/var/spool/uucppublic:/usr/lib/uucp/uucico 
 listen:x:37:4:Network Admin:/usr/net/nls: 
 nobody:x:60001:60001:uid no body:/: 
 ftp:x:60002:60002:Anonymous FTP:/home/ftp: 
 noaccess:x:60002:60002:uid no access:/: 
This is quite a bad example as there are no passwords in it, but I'll do my 
best.  Let's take the first entry.  This is for the user 'root'.  The 
password is encrypted, and because of the method Unix uses to do it (a sort 
of one-way algorithm), you can't decrypt it.  The only way you can find out 
what the password is to use a Unix password cracker.  All that does is 
keep encrypting common passwords from a dictionary (that you can edit) 
until they match the encrypted one you have.  The trouble is, the 
person who set the passwords is even remotely intelligent, they will use a 
random alphanumeric one like b24svs2, which would be uncrackable without 
**A LOT** of patience. 
  Telnetting without a shell account... my ISP is Planet Internet in the 
UK, run by AT&T.  Despite who it's run by, they don't seem to care what the 
hell I do either.  Long live these gods of ISPs!

HACKING UNIX LOG FILES 
Unlike the passwd file, this cannot be viewed or edited in notepad.  You'll 
need a program to do it for me.  If anyone's interested, contact me and 
I'll send you some.  (If I get too much response I'll post it here). 
REMEMBER though, altering the log files is illegal.  I don't accept any 
responsibility for what you do with the file.

HACKING WINDOWS PASSWORDS

Here's an extract from the alt.2600 FAQ beta .013 regarding the matter: 
I will describe the process starting after you've entered the password 
and hit the [OK] button.

I will make the assumption that everyone (at least those interested) know 
what the XOR operation is.

First, the length of the password is saved.  We'll call this 'len'.  We 
will be moving characters from the entered string into another string as 
they are encrypted.  We'll call the originally entered password 
'plaintext' and the encrypted string(strings--there are two passes) 
'hash1' and 'hash2.'  The position in the plaintext is important during 
the process so we'll refer to this as 'pos.'  After each step of the 
hashing process, the character is checked against a set of characters 
that windows considers 'special.'  These characters are '[ ] =' and any 
character below ASCII 33 or above ASCII 126.  I'll refer to this 
checking operation as 'is_ok.'  All indices are zero-based (i.e. an 8 
character password is considered chars 0 to 7).

Now, the first character of 'plaintext' is xor'd with 'len' then fed to 
'is_ok'.  if the character is not valid, it is replaced by the original 
character of 'plaintext' before going to the next operation.  The next 
operation is to xor with 'pos' (this is useless for the first operation 
since 'len' is 0 and anything xor'd with zero is itself) then fed to 
'is_ok' and replaced with the original if not valid.  The final 
operation (per character) is to xor it with the previous character of 
'plaintext'. Since there is no previous character, the fixed value, 42, 
is used on the first character of 'plaintext'.  This is then fed to 
'is_ok' and if OK, it is stored into the first position of 'hash1'  This 
process proceeds until all characters of plaintext are exhausted.

The second pass is very similar, only now, the starting point is the 
last character in hash1 and the results are placed into hash2 from the 
end to the beginning.  Also, instead of using the previous character in 
the final xoring, the character following the current character is used. 
Since there is no character following the last character in hash1, the 
value, 42 is again used for the last character.

'hash2' is the final string and this is what windows saves in the file 
CONTROL.INI.

To 'decrypt' the password, the above procedure is just reversed.

If you want to hack the password for the screen saver in a Radio Shack 
store (in the US), try: 
RS<store_number> 
Then change the screen saver to that scrolly one and make the text "Radio 
Shack - High Prices - Low Quality Goods" or something like that.

Hi, 
To whoever posted the above: I work with less(and more, and was actually 
thinking of writing something called most or least) on SGI Irix's, BSDi 
and FreeBSD machines, Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.5.1, and AIX 3.2.X and 4.2.  I 
don't remember which ones it came installed on, but now it's on all of 
them, and these are definitely more serious than Linux(spit) boxes...

And one other thing--there could be a difference between 
more /etc/services 
and 
cat /etc/services| more 
if additional output redirection was used in the same command line, or if 
the directory separation character (IFS) was changed to | from / for example. 
And either way, /etc/services is only the registered ports on that 
machine! It's not every port Unix can understand, like someone said in 
the digest...Try comparing other files on that system with /etc/services 
to see the difference, like inetd.conf...
