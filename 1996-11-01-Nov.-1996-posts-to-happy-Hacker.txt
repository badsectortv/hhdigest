I have a boilerplate e-mail/fax/memo for e-mail/fax spammers.  It quotes 
from the relevant sections of federal law, with the fines bolded and in 
20-point type (all caps, too!).  When I get an unsolicited fax, I fax it 
back to the sender with the memo.  I also use it for unsolicited e-mail.=20 
With unsolicited e-mail, you need to be careful, as sometimes, buried in 
the body of the spam, is the "reply-to" e-mail address - you don't just 
hit "reply."

I've used it for a while now, with good results.  It follows, in case 
you'd like to try this approach.

IN RESPONSE TO YOUR UNSOLICITED FAX, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING AND IMMEDIAT= 
ELY CEASE AND DESIST SENDING UNSOLICITED FAXES TO FAX NUMBER (xxx) 
xxx-xxxx. 
<OR UNSOLICITED e-mail TO e-mail ADDRESS xxx@xxx.xxx>

Under US Code Title 47, =A7227(b)(1)(C):

=09"It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States to 
=09 use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device 
=09 to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile 
=09 machine"

A "telephone facsimile machine" is defined in =A7227(a)(2)(B) as:

=09"equipment which has the capacity to transcribe text or images 
=09 (or both) from an electronic signal received over a regular 
=09 telephone line onto paper."

Under this definition, an e-mail account, modem, computer and printer 
together constitute a fax machine.

The rights of action are as follows.  Under =A7227(b)(3)(B):

=09"A person or entity may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or 
=09 rules of court of a State, bring in an appropriate court of 
=09 that State --

=09  (A) an action based on a violation of this subsection or the 
=09      regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin 
=09      such violation,=20 
=09  (B) an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a 
=09      violation, or to receive $500 in damages for each such 
=09      violation, whichever is greater, or=20 
=09  (C) both such actions. If the court finds that the defendant 
=09      willfully or knowingly violated this subsection or the 
=09      regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court 
=09      may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award 
=09      to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount 
=09      available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph." 
 

THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION 
 

Good Luck!

Subject: HH: More on Giant Pings

I did a little checking on Usenet for the reaction to the news about the 
giant ping datagram attack. Here's a quick summary.

1) People are really paranoid about describing exactly how it can be done.

2) There is a lot of misinformation floating around. Most significantly, 
it has been asserted that only Windows 95 and Windows NT can do this. 
This is not true. It is just that these are the only two operating systems 
that can do it with a simple one-line command.

3) I haven't encountered any reports of giant datagram pings being used 
to attack Internet hosts and routers.

4) The patches that can protect your system against this attack are 
posted at http://www.uk.linux.org/patches/. More information may be found 
at http://www.sophist.demon.co.uk/ping/.

Regarding discussion of this attack on this list, there have been 
comments about how it can't be elite and isn't really hacking if it can 
be done easily from Windows 95 (or Windows NT). I agree it isn't elite. 
It's too easy to be elite. BUT -- you have just learned how to do 
something that some day may cause a really big disaster on the internet. 
How many people use Windows 95 or Windows NT? Millions. How many are 
someday going to be really, really mad enough to send out just one funny 
ping?

So what is the solution? On Usenet I see all these guys tiptoeing around 
trying to talk about the problem without saying what exactly it is. They 
are really afraid that a bunch of idiots will start pinging down huge 
hunks of the Internet. Meanwhile, CERT, which is supposed to save us from 
giant Internet disasters, hasn't said anything about the problem.

My guess is that we are seeing ostrich behavior. Hush up the problem and 
no one will exploit it. Ever. Sure.

Just think how this could be used. All it takes is one ping to zap each 
vulnerable host. One crank could take out thousands of hosts per day by 
hand. If he or she knows how to write a DOS .bat file, it could be lots more.

Should the ability of the Internet to keep running be dependent upon 
everyone who knows how to use the network diagnostic functions of Windows 
being good guys?

The reason I published exact details of how you could make these killer 
pings was to prove to you how easy it is for absolute beginners to do 
deadly hacker attacks.

IMHO, if the Internet is safe only by everyone agreeing be good guys, 
then we are in deep trouble. What is to keep terrorists or a nation at war 
from wreaking the Internet? Especially when it is so easy to do?

If you just joined the list, and would like a copy of the issue of Guide 
to (mostly) Harmless Hacking that details how to do the killer ping 
exploit, email me and I'll send it to you.

If you read the laws, I think you will find that even connecting to a port 
with intention to gain access is in fact illegal.

any status. Any access to the system is illegal. 
 

For those of you with linux or some other version of unix who would like 
to know a little more about this.. look at your /etc/inetd.conf file. :)

Looking to make trouble.  Web TV offers the ability.

Go to your local electronics dealer... Circuit City, Fry's, Good Guys, 
etc.  Pretend to be very interested.  Send yourself an e-mail.

You now have the e-mail address for their Web TV account.  What you 
send them to possibly be revealed to an unsuspecting customer is up to 
you.  I'm not sure if the e-mailer handles attachments, but if you 
could send some of your favorite gif or .jpeg files...

Denial of service attacks are growing, but they require some knowledge to 
use the programs to work and also equipment.  An ISP here in El Paso had 
one of its users trying a Denial of service attack (ping flood), but his 
program was configured wrong and he actually took out the ISP network.

The Win 95 bug is a big threat only for the local network.  Once the ping 
hits a router it is no longer a threat.  We have been testing with all the 
machines listed in the problems list.  We have found that once it went 
past our router that there was no affect.  But if the machine were on this 
side of it (local), the puter bit it big time.  This is a worry to us at 
Universities because some of the student information is stored on these 
boxes.  And since labs are setup with win 95 it could pose a threat.  But 
with patches available it has been calmed down.

Denial of servie is a last resort attack.  Most would like to gain access 
to it rather then let no one access it.  But it could grow in the coming 
months......if you can't hack it....jack it (let no one use it).  With 
program available in the public domain, anyone can be dangerous.  But 
these attacks have not become a serious threat yet.

Most people don't have the bandwidth to be dangerous. Even a 28.8 PPP'd is 
not a big threat unlike a ISDN line.

Yes codes out there but you need to have equipment to do it. This is what 
makes the difference.  We have done some testing and you need to have a 
network that can handle the traffic.  Plus some places have cutoff on alot 
of traffic coming from a port.  Once they start to flood the network, they 
get shutoff.

I might be able to let you try on a system, but it would have to be 
controled experiment.  We are intrested on the results we gather.  I do 
alot of R&D here and this is one thing we are exploring.  We have alot of 
machine you could help us with.  But controled in that it can be stoped so 
we can gather information.  I would be willing to call you and find out 
what you would like to try.

Hi again...

It's me...

Yup, it's Friday...

Yet another HP bug has arrived at the HP Bug of the Week.  That's 
http://command.com.inter.net/~sod/ for those of you who haven't been

So...

I guess you'll hafta come and take a look at it again now..

Mmmmmm...

So...

I bet you really wanna know what's broken this week... Probably, maybe..

Well, OK, I'll tell ya.  But you're not gonna like it..

I mean, really, you're gonna say "You've _got_ to be kidding me."

Seriously..

So...

That program.. Well, it's rdist.

Yup..

For 10.X..

Mmmmmm...

It's really more of an implementation than an exploit, really, but hey, 
whatever works, ya know?

So git yer ass on over to our little page care of us folk at SOD, where one 
bug a week is the promise we keep, lest our souls get all icky and gross in 
the murkiest swamp o' hell.

G'day.

SPECIAL NOTE TO OUR FRIENDS AT HP:

Well, Hi there!  It's me, your friend, yet again.  I'm just sitting here 
sipping my Earl Gray with honey wondering how it is that you can rationalize 
continuing your company without me.  Hmmmm.  Let me think.  If all those 
logic courses I took back in college were any help at all, I should be able 
to develop a rational argument for that.  Hmmmm.  Hmmmm.  Nope, don't think 
I can right now.  The way I see it, you've got everything to gain and nothing 
lose except for a fiscal mass, of course.  Isn't a more secure operating 
system WORTH a few measly million dollars??  Why, of course it is.  I knew 
you'd see it my way.  And while you're seeing it my way, why don't you think 
about getting me laid, too -- I'd *really* appreciate that, and believe me, 
I'd show my gratitude.  So why not come browse your ass on over to that 
little URL up there, and then maybe our attorneys will screw each other and 
come up with a fair and reasonable offer that both of us will appreciate.

This CIAC bulletin is the *first* official warning of the killer ping 
vulnerability.  Remember, you read about it from the Happy Hacker list 
first, weeks ago!  If you are a new subscriber, you can see our web page 
http://www.feist.com/~tqdb/evis-unv.html for details of exactly how this 
attack is done -- and why it wouldn't be elite to do it.

If you think killer ping is bad, just imagine what attacks I'm *not* 
telling you about on account of how hairy they are. Bottom line: the 
Internet only stays in operation on account of the most elite of hackers 
being good guys.

          Due to the critical nature of this defect, HP is introducing 
          this as a non-cumulative patch.  As a result, in cases where 
          a dependency exists, the current ARPA Transport cumulative 
          patch will need to be installed first.  The two can be 
          installed in the same session to minimize system downtime, 
          but the prerequisite patch must be loaded first. 
          Installation will fail if this is not the case.

AVAILABILITY: All patches are available now.

I. Update

   A. Problem description

   A recent mailing list disclosure described a vulnerability in which 
   specific, illegally formatted, incoming ICMP Echo Request (ping) 
   traffic could cause a system reboot on some HP9000 Series 700, 
   and 800 systems running HP-UX releases 9.X and 10.X.  HP9000 Series 
   300 and 400 systems have not been found to be vulnerable.

   B. Fixing the problem

   The vulnerability can be eliminated from HP-UX releases 9.X and 10.X 
   by applying either one or two patches.

Subject: HH: Email forging tips 
From: norzer@fastrans.net

Greetingz . I am new to this list so i dont know if this lil 
secret (lame) has ever been brought to anyones attention..

It has to do w/ sending anony email over the net.. Of course, it is 
never 100% anonymous when sending anony email using any technique.. 
Most everyone who knows how to send anony email can find out who's 
sending anony email..   The following is just another method to send 
anonymous email w/o having to go through all those pain in da ass 
mail port programs..

This technique has to do w/ using Lynx (every unix geekz favorite web 
browser).. I am assuming since you subscribe to this list you know 
what Lynx is.. If not, telnet to your shell account and type "LYNX" 
at the prompt and (hopefully) Unix will load up its all text web 
browser*..  Next go to a page that has the persons email address on 
it, then follow that (MAILTO:) link.. and LYNX will promt you enter 
who the message is FROM.. so now you have the opportuny to enter 
whatever email address you want..  Anyone who uses email programs 
like Eudoara, Pegasus, MS Mail, etc have no way of detecting this.. 
However, anyone who uses pines (Advanced Header Mode) can find out 
where its coming from..

If the person you want to send an anony email to doesnt have a link 
to their email on a web page that you know of.. You can do one of 2 
things.. 
  1) Create a web page yourself w/ a link to their email on it.. 
(Should take 20 seconds) 
 2) Lynx gives you the option to CC your messasge to multiple email 
addresses.. So you can just send the email to whoever 
(postmaster@aol.com maybe?? muhaha) and then just CC their mail 
address in the CC field..

 Well.. thatz basically it.. I will be putting up a page w/ all kinds 
of cool useful facts, links, tools regarding all aspects of hacking, 
corruption in america, Govt Secrets, etc.. Email me if you want me to 
notify you when its up.. Laterz 
 

*NOTE... This is also a way to get around the web a hell of alot 
quicker w/o having to load all those bandwith hoging, annoying 
graphics..

Is that to say Daemon9 is a wannabe hacker for releasing it or something? 
And how do you know those who did it were clueless? Or maybe they wrote 
their own SYN flood code?

Just pointing out that you are quick to brand people as 'wannabe'.

(Moderator's note: In my book, anyone who uses a canned hacker tool such 
as the Phrack syn flood exploit is a clueless wannabe. Did any of the 
attackers write their own code? Well, it happens that the syn flood 
attack has been known since at least 1984. Was it coincidence that a 
bunch of syn flood attacks were launched just after the exploit code was 
released by Phrack? So flame me if I'm being a big meanie.)

I have recruited Daemon9 onto my speaking circuit, and I'll tell you, he 
is damn intelligent and very good at what he does. He identified himself 
to NASA as the person behind SYN flooding code and exploits, and 
demonstrated a version called Poseidon, which is far more lethal than the

I want this posted on your list.
