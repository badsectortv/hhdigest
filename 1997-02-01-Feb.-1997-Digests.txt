Wow...

I found your guides just great. They were so helpful and you seemed 
to cover everything. But I did have two quick questions:

1.  As I was Port surfing around I came upon a site with a command called 
"Adduser". Is this what I think it is? Could I be making my own user 
 accounts?

2. After I find a computer with security hole, I don't know what to 
do from there on. I don't want to make any stupid mistakes. Could you 
please help me.

Thanks a Lot!

Concerning the C++ compiler.

Try aol's file libaries.  They have an C compiler.  I have a copy, and would 
be willing to mail it to the person whom wants it as an e-mail attachment.

Make me Anon.!

I have found a sendmail program that is ver. 7.?.?. 
That is not what it says but I can not remember. 
Anyway I do not have to login or use the "helo" command at all. 
This is just for verification this is a good place to send fake e-mail 
right? 
Also I am thinking of sending an anon e-mail to there system administrator 
through 
there port 25 and warning them that there are some security leaks in your 
server. 
Is that really stupid? 
I know this sounds newbieish but that is what I am a newbie.

(Moderator: you are absolutely right, old sendmail versions are a major 
security risk. If I were you, yes, I'd send the sysadmin an email warning 
him or her of the problem. I definitely would not try out any of the 
sendmail exploit programs to gain root access to that system.)

(Moderator: following are some security advisories that should be of 
especial interest to advanced newbie to intermediate hackers.)

Subject:      Another NT CPU Hog ? 
To: BUGTRAQ@NETSPACE.ORG

I can put any NT server I have on its knees by just 
connecting to a shared network drive on the server 
(for example from a PC running Windows 95) and 
transfer a large file file (>100 MBytes) from/to the server.

File transfer begins normally, but after few seconds, the 
poor NT box is completely frozen. File transfer continues 
normally, but eat 100% CPU time (he, sounds familiar, isn't it ?)

Is anybody able reproduce this "bug" ?

The issue we released an advisory on was the NT DNS server choking and 
dying when it received a response for a query it never issued. The patch

Yep, it is in fact an unsupported patch.

While the patch does not work for what *we* reported, it did seem to fix 
the 100% CPU usage problem. Cold comfort considering anyone, anywhere on 
the Internet can easily *remove* your DNS server.

EXPORTABLE CRYPTOGRAPHY TOTALLY INSECURE: CHALLENGE CIPHER BROKEN IMMEDIATELY 
  
January 28, 1997 - Ian Goldberg, a UC Berkeley graduate student, announced 
today that he had successfully cracked RSA Data Security Inc.'s 40-bit 
challenge cipher in just under 3.5 hours. 
  
RSA challenged scientists to break their encryption technology, offering a 
$1000 award for breaking the weakest version of the code.  Their offering 
was designed to stimulate research and practical experience with the security 
of today's codes. 
  
The number of bits in a cipher is an indication of the maximum level of 
security the cipher can provide.  Each additional bit doubles the potential 
security level of the cipher.  A recent panel of experts recommended 
using 90-bit ciphers, and 128-bit ciphers are commonly used throughout 
the world, but US government regulations restrict exportable US products 
to a mere 40 bits. 
  
Goldberg's announcement, which came just three and a half hours after 
RSA started their contest, provides very strong evidence that 40-bit 
ciphers are totally unsuitable for practical security.  "This is the 
final proof of what we've known for years: 40-bit encryption technology 
is obsolete," Goldberg said. 
  
The US export restrictions have limited the deployment of technology 
that could greatly strengthen security on the Internet, often affecting 
both foreign and domestic users.  "We know how to build strong 
encryption; the government just won't let us deploy it.  We need strong 
encryption to uphold privacy, maintain security, and support commerce on 
the Internet -- these export restrictions on cryptography must be 
lifted,"  Goldberg explained.  Fittingly, when Goldberg finally 
unscrambled the challenge message, it read: "This is why you should use 
a longer key." 
  
Goldberg used UC Berkeley's Network of Workstations (known as the NOW) to 
harness the computational resources of about 250 idle machines.  This allowed 
him to test 100 billion possible "keys" per hour -- analogous to safecracking 
by trying every possible combination at high speed.  This amount of computing 
power is available with little overhead cost to students and employees at 
many large educational institutions and corporations. 
  
Goldberg is a founding member of the ISAAC computer security research group 
at UC Berkeley.  In the Fall of 1995, the ISAAC group made headlines by 
revealing a major security flaw in Netscape's web browser.

Wiretappers struggle to keep lines open

BY STEPHEN LYNCH 
Orange County Register

Law enforcement officials tap as many as 116 telephone lines a day 
in Orange County, according to an FBI report that for the first 
time details the pervasiveness of electronic surveillance.

The unprecedented disclosure of wiretaps nationwide is part of an 
effort by police officers and federal agents to gain access to 
high-tech phone systems, which in some cases block traditional 
surveillance techniques.

A 1994 law, the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, 
requires companies such as Pacific Bell and GTE to keep the lines 
accessible, even as they upgrade to more reliable, digital 
networks.

The FBI report, released last week, said Orange County phone 
companies should allow federal, state and local authorities to 
monitor up to 194 lines simultaneously, to allow for population 
growth.

``Wiretap usage has been going up every year for several years,'' 
said Frederick Hess, director of the office of enforcement 
operations in the Department of Justice. ``It's an indispensable 
aid.''

Hess cited Operation Zorro II, a massive drug investigation that 
nabbed 150 trafficking suspects in May. Officials tapped phone 
lines in a dozen states, including California, to build their 
case. Wiretaps also are playing a major role in a case against a 
Santa Ana man whom authorities allege is a member of the Mexican 
mafia.

``It's very difficult to escape prosecution when your voice is on 
tape,'' Hess said. ``We had John Gotti talking about killing 
people -- he's dead in the water at that point.''

That power, ironically, is threatened by clearer, faster telephone 
systems.

Pacific Bell, for instance, has about 30 stations in Orange County 
that route calls, called ``switches.'' Each switch is being 
replaced with a computer system that routes digital information. 
Before, authorities could place a device on a phone line, called a 
``loop,'' and hear the conversation. With a digital system, all 
they would hear is the sound of binary beeps, like the static on a 
modem.

The software to translate the digits into voices at the switch has 
not been developed yet, as phone companies and the FBI negotiate a 
reasonable wiretap capacity. It's an expensive proposition, and 
Ron Peat, director of federal relations for Pacific Telesis, 
complained that authorities are inflating the figures and driving 
up the price.

The higher the capacity for wiretaps, the more it costs, and law 
enforcement doesn't need access to 194 lines at each station, Peat 
maintained.

``What they have done is take the busiest area of the county and 
made it the standard for the whole area,'' he said. ``They need to 
set priorities.  The office in Brea may never need a wiretap.''

The last estimate by the telephone companies for a nationwide 
overhaul is $2 billion. Yet Congress has authorized only $500 
million for wiretap capacity, and only $100 million of that has 
been released, Peat said.

Pacific Bell has not waited for the problem to be resolved. Some 
digital switches are already in place, without the tapping 
software, though Peat said no one has needed to monitor the line yet.

The FBI took the wiretap figures from the busiest day in a 
16-month period between 1993 and 1995. Orange County ranked third 
in California counties for wiretaps, behind Los Angeles (1,080 in 
one day) and San Diego (263). The total for the state is 2,569, 
but officials warn that the figure is deceptive. Each county's 
peak probably was reached on a different day.

The national figure, with the same caveat, is 24,617.

Wiretaps are used mainly by federal authorities, said Carl 
Armbrust, chief of narcotics enforcement for the Orange County 
District Attorney's Office.

``We've only used it about three times in the last few years,'' 
said Armbrust, who noted that state wiretap guidelines are more 
restrictive than federal rules.

But the overall numbers surprised some civil libertarians and 
defense attorneys, who didn't realize wiretaps were so 
widespread.

``One hundred and sixteen? Really?'' said Allan Stokke, a criminal 
defense attorney in Santa Ana. ``That sounds really high to me. 
Many, many judges seem to be giving the authority.''

Stokke worries that prosecutors are not disclosing wiretaps if 
evidence from them isn't introduced at trial. He added that the 
technological problems ``may be a good thing. It should never be 
easy to intrude on people's privacy.''

But Hess said the increased tapping capacity will only keep pace 
with the growing population, and remains a small percentage of the 
total number of phone lines.

``We're trying to figure out what's within reason for the growth 
of the country,'' he said. ``These are all court-ordered taps, 
nothing illicit. If we don't do this, there's going to be a big 
problem.''
