 *** Chat and Beginners Exploits 
================================================================== 
From: "®3\\/×© ®@© |{ø(\\/)Å±1©2600" <revbezalel@hotmail.com>

I am going to have at my website www.angelfire.com/sd/bezalel/ ten chat 
rooms for my fellow happy hackers.  Twenty-four people can chat in one 
room.  Right now I only have two chat rooms open and they are empty one 
hundred percent of the time, but hopefully that will change.  Oh yeah, and 
here are some beginners exploits.

Exploits 
To get the passwd file ,try using an FTP client to access the site anonymously 
then check the /etc directory to see if access to the passwd file is 
restricted. 
If it is not restricted then download the file and run any one of a wide 
assortment of cracker programs on it. If it is restricted then try this. Some 
systems there is a file called PHF in the /cgi-bin directory. If there is then 
you are in luck. PHF allows users to gain remote access to files (including the 
/etc/passwd file) over the world wide web. To try this method goto your web 
browser and type one of these URL's:

http://xxx.xxx.xxx/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd 
http://xxx.xxx.xxx/cgi-bin/php.cgi?/etc/passwdhttp://xxx.xxx.xxx/~root 
http://xxx.xxx.xxx/cgi-bin/test-cgi?* HTTP/1.0 
http://xxx.xxx.xxx/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?* HTTP/1.0 
http://xxx.xxx.xxx/samples/search/queryhit.html 
http://xxx.xxx.xxx/scripts/samples/search/webhits.exe 
http://xxx.xxx.xxx/_vti_pvt/service.pwd 
http://xxx.xxx.xxx/secret/files/default.asp.

Substitute the site you are trying to hack for the xxx.xxx.xxx.

If the preceding methods fail then try any way you can think of to get that 
file. If you do get the file and all the items in the second field are X or! 
or * then the password file is shadowed. Shadowing is just a method of adding 
extra security to prevent hackers and other unwanted people from using the 
password file. Unfortunately there is no way to "unshadow" a password file 
but sometimes there are backup password files that aren't shadowed. Try 
looking for files such as /etc/shadow and other stuff like that.

A single entry of a passwd file entry might look like this: 
               PASSWORD        GROUP NUMBER      HOME DIRECTORY 
              /               /                  / 
             /               /                  / 
rbezalel:8d34jSjs73hsb:2162:15:ReverendBezalel:/usr/users/rbezalel:/usr/bin/ksh 
 \                      \             \                             \ 
  \                      \             \                             \ 
   USERNAME               USER NUMBER   GECOS INFORMATION            SHELL

Now take a look at the PASSWORD in this entry: 8d34jSjs73hsb. This is, in 
fact, NOT the password. It is, instead, the encrypted equivalent TO the 
password. As part of the UNIX Account Registration process, when a User 
designates a password, the UNIX takes the password, and (*this is 
important*) uses the other information from the account to generate an 
encrypted equivalent to the actual password. Why? Because as part of the 
UNIX operating system, users MUST have access to the 'passwd' file to be 
able to login. But if anyone who has an account can access the 'passwd' 
file, they can also see what everyone else's Password is. So, UNIX's 
security against this is to encrypt the password entry for each users 
account so that no one else will know what anyone other than their 
password is. Fortunately the algorithm UNIX uses to perform this 
encryption has been known to Crackers for sometime.

And so if you can see this: 
           encrypted equivalent of password 
             / 
rebezalel:8d34jSjs73hsb:2162:15:ReverendBezalel:/usr/users/rbezalel:/usr/bin/ksh

[Dale: This tip seems to be unfinished. i think that the author meant to say 
that 
if you can see the encrypted equivalent of the password, then you can crack it 
using a program like Cracker jack...]

Thank you for your time,

From: "Alexey L. Popov" <alpopov@elkamail.ru> 
 

Hello Dale. 
I wasn't sure to what address I should write to get to the digest 
so I selected yours, sorry.

Please let others know that Rhino9 server could be found at 
http://207.98.195.250, or one could try web search for documents 
titled Rhino9 Security Research Team since their site has changes 
locations several times.

Thanks for maintaining this digest.

Hello, in the July 7 1998 GTMHH, there was a message stating that 
rhino.org domain is now gone. Just wanted to make sure that everyone 
knows you can still get to the site @ http://207.98.195.250/

IMHO it is a great site and although the domain is gone (for whatever 
reason) the site is still up.

Thanks, 
The Slycer..

Hi!

Strange, I could read the message in the digest 7/7:

>Could you let your other readers know that rhino9.org, that is mentioned 
>in the 29 June issue of the Happy Hacker's Digest, is gone. Thank you.

Strange, while I was reading this, I had my browser connected to the site. 
Try http://207.98.195.250/

Maybe there's a problem resolving the dns?

Greetings, 
Johan.

 *** VBScript exploit? 
================================================================= 
From: <VM370x@aol.com>

Hi, 
I was looking through the MS VBScript documentation and I noticed 
several things (such as the FileSystemObject) that look like clear 
security holes.

The example of this object shows the creation of a new text file 
in the root directory and some text being appended.  It wouldn't 
be too good to have WriteLine("del c:\io.sys") appended to 
autoexec.bat would it?  I wish I could test this, but I don't have 
DCOM installed so I can't run the VBScript Engine v2.

Oah well, later- 
================================================================= 
 ***  MINIX 
================================================================= 
From: Renos <renosm@yahoo.com>

Hi Carolyn!   Lately I have been searching to find an easy-to-install 
UNIX like Operating System. I didn't want to make a 500MB partition 
on my HD for a Linux Instalation. I read in previous issues of HH 
about some UNIX like OSes that could run on Win95. They also had 
small sizes and of course you didn't have to make a new partitions 
on your HD. Keeping on searching I finally found a cool one Unix 
like OS called Minix!

Minix needs only 30MB of hard disk for a full instalation. It's 
free and it comes with the sources! You can install it on a XT,286, 
386, 486, 586,... If you still don't want to make a partition there is 
Test-Minix. It's the Minix OS which can be run from the DOS prompt! 
It's only 10MB (the Download size in is 2MB). It doesn't contain the 
sources, and you must have at least a 386 with 4MB RAM . It contains 
among other things the cc compiler, Internet tools such as telnet, 
ftp, ping and deamons such as telnetd, ftpd, etc.

More infos about MINIX and Test-Minix can be found at:

 *** Editorial: What is SPAM anyway? 
================================================================= 
From: Dale Holmes <editor@techbroker.com>

What the heck is SPAM anyway? Well, there are two schools of thought. 
SPAM is known to people around the world as a luncheon meat of legend. 
People *worship* SPAM (http://www.iconnect.net/home/jstrong/spam.html). 
SPAM has inspired millions to philosophise and express their innermost 
thoughts and feelings (http://pemtropics.mit.edu/~jcho/spam/). SPAM has 
become perhaps the most closely watched and talked about luncheon meat 
of all time. Here are some SPAM facts:

- In America, it's consumed at the rate of 3.8 cans a second by more than 
60 million Americans. 
- It's trademarked in 92 countries, and sold in 45, from Anguilla to Zimbabwe. 
- If laid end-to-end, 5 billion cans would encircle the earth 12 1/2 times. 
- 5 billion cans of SPAM would feed a family of four, three meals a day, for 
4,566,210 years. 
- You can grill more than 29 billion Spamburgers with it, and that supply 
would last 5.4 days if everyone on Earth ate one spamburger for dinner each 
night. 
- Each year, 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of Spam are sold around the 
world. 
- SPAM is made in two U.S. locations - Austin, Minnesota, and Fremont, 
Nebraska - 
and seven other countries: England, Australia, Denmark, Phillipines, Japan, 
Taiwan, and South Korea. 
- The average consumers of Spam are families with several children, especially 
in the southeastern U.S. 
- In 1989, the U.S. armed forces bought 3.3 million pounds of SPAM. 
- Hawaii, Alaska, Arkansas, Texas, and Alabama rate the highest in spam 
consumption respectively. 
- Among the 50 foreign countries where Spam is sold, the UK and South Korea 
are the largest markets. 
- In South Korea, SPAM is considered an upscale food and one of the most 
popular American imports. The Wall Street Journal recently spotted a Seoul 
executive in search of the perfect gift. The executive deliberately skipped 
over traditional gift items such as wine and chocolates in favor of SPAM, 
explaining, "It is an impressive gift." 
- Hormel PR man Allen Krejci says: "SPAM has endured because of it's 
convenience 
and versatility. You can eat it hot or cold. You slice, dice, or cube it. You 
can eat it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snacks. In fact, the only thing 
that 
limits your use of SPAM is your imagination." 
- Nikita Krushchev once credited SPAM with the survival of the WWII Russian 
army. ''Without SPAM, we wouldn't have been able to feed our army,'' he said. 
- Senator Robert Byrd of West Viginia eats a sandwich of SPAM and mayonnaise 
on white bread three times a week. 
- Number of miles a snowmobile must drive at -30 F to fully brown a can of Spam 
wired to the engine: 35 (Source: The Iditarod [heard on a Madison, WI radio 
report for "National Canned Luncheon Meat Day, '96])

All this is amazing, but it has little to do with hackers... Another take on 
SPAM, 
however, is much more serious. SPAM is the nickname for unsolicited junk email. 
Usually this email comes from a commercial entity trying to sell some product or 
service, or worse, trying to run some fraudulent scam.

These emails tend to have false headers so that the reply to address is faked. 
If a recipient tries to respond to the email to get themselves removed from 
the list, their message bounces back as undeliverable.

SPAM also includes advertisements placed in bulk to Usenet newsgroups. Usually, 
these ads are placed in hundreds of newsgroups at a time, without regard to the 
subject matter that the group was setup for. Ads of this nature clog up 
newsgroups 
to the point where it is difficult to find any posts that are actually on the 
newsgroup's topic.

SPAM makes use of Internet email and Usenet newsgroups very frustrating. 
Many people 
say that there should be a law preventing SPAM. Soon, there might be one. The US 
Federal Trade Commision (FTC) will be releasing a report soon making 
recommendations 
to the US government and to the technology industry about how to fight SPAM.

Though their intentions are good, the US government will probably miss the boat 
when it comes to the SPAM wars. They tend to miss their targets in 
technology issues 
 - just look at WIPO, or the DOJ case against Microsoft. It scares me a 
little when 
I think of governments deciding the fate of my email based upon its content. 
I hate 
SPAM! But, I want to be the one defining what is and isn't SPAM in *my* inbox.

How do you feel about it? What can you do? A good place to start it the Web 
site for 
the Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email (CAUCE). Visit the site at 
http://www.cauce.org/ and read about the issue. There are links from there 
to other 
reaources for SPAM war information, as well as instructions on how to avoid 
becoming 
a SPAM victim yourself. If it is too late for that, there is also 
information on 
how to detect the source of SPAM, and what you can do about it once you know 
who is 
spamming you.

I suggest you read about it while eating a plate of SPAM, eggs, bacon, and SPAM 
(http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/spam.html#MontyPython).
