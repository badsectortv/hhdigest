 *** What happened to the last 2 Digests?!? 
================================================================== 
From: Dale Holmes <editor@techbroker.com>

As you might have noticed, there have not been any Digest's for the past 2 
weeks. I apologize for the interruption of service - it is entirely my 
fault. As usual, I got myself in over my head again. No, I didn't destroy 
any laptops this time. I simply commited to a submission deadline for my 
newest book that was completely insane. After 2 weeks of working nearly 24 
hours a day, it is finished and I can resume my regularly scheduled life 
already in progress.

I had originally planned to issue a few Digest's in a row to catch up, but 
looking at the current list of messages, I think I'll just pick up this week 
where I left off and we'll just skip the last 2 weeks.

Thanks for being patient. And if you're planning to get your MCSE, rush out 
in a buying frenzy for my upcoming book on the Windows 98 test from Macmillan 
Computer Publishing, or simply send your entire wallet to me... (just 
kidding). The book will be on the shelves before Christmas. The other 4 
books I've worked on are already available.

 *** Send me your Questions 
=================================================================== 
From: Dale Holmes <editor@techbroker.com>

Another note from me:

I'd like to hear what people new to computer security are most interested 
in. Please send me, care of the editor@techbroker address, your questions 
regarding computer security specific issues.

A question like "How do I hack?" is not really a good one, but a question 
like "What is PGP?" or "How does PPTP work?" is more what I am looking for. 
I would like to really boost the question and answers section of the Digest 
into a useful resource for learning rather than a forum for quick fixes to 
simple problems (although those are OK too...).

I need your help to do this. If you are at all curious about these kinds of 
subjects, chances are lots of other people are too. Share your curiosity, 
and together we'll gather more resources and information to develop a real 
knowlegde base in computer security, or at least we'll make a start toward 
that end.

So ask away...

Thanks. 
Dale

 *** Windows Scripting Host 
================================================================== 
From: "Bill" <billh@lgcy.com>

I have been studying "Windows Scripting Host" (WSH for short).  It is a 
scripting engine which is run at the command line of Windows NT and seems to 
be an attempt to equal the command line power of the Unix Command line shell.

With it one can run a JScript or VBscript from the Windows NT or Windows 
95/98 command line.  Other scripting languages can be plugged into it.  It 
is part of the Windows NT option pack.

 *** *FREE* NFR Technical Workshops 
================================================================== 
From: "Deborah A. Greenberg" <dag@nfr.net>

[Dale: This notice was posted to the Network Flight Recorder users mailing 
list. I thought it would be of interest to readeers of the HHD, so I am 
copying it here. For more infor on NFR, please visit the web site at: 
http://www.nfr.net]

Network Flight Recorder is pleased to announce the *FREE* NFR Technical 
Workshopsto be held in two locations in the United States:

09 Nov 1998 (Monday)  16 Nov 1998 
8:30 AM - 4:30 PM               8:30 AM - 4:30 PM 
Marriott Fairview Park  Westin Santa Clara 
Falls Church, Virginia  Santa Clara, California 
(Washington, DC Area)  (Silicon Valley Area)

As the name suggests, these will be technical discussions.  NFR staffers 
will provide a half-day tutorial on creating backends and packages. 
They'll explain the basics of N-Code to get you up and running with your 
own backends.  They'll provide tips on using some of the features and 
statements that'll really help you get what you need from your datastream. 
We also invite NFR users to present case studies on how they're using 
NFR at their site.  Chances are, there are others who will benefit from 
the knowledge you gained about protocols, programming, or office 
politics.  We encourage you to present a case study.

Registration is required and seating is limited.  More information about 
the conference, including registration forms and what to do if you 
want to present a case study, can be found on the NFR Web site:

From: "Fällström" <mt20436@tellus.swipnet.se>

[Dale: I don't know what this means, but it is probably useful to somebody. 
If you can translate this, I'd be interested in finding out what it really 
says...]

Faan vad är nu detta för skit tänkte jag, jag började testa lite 
kombinationer men insåg snart att det var omöjligt.

det jag vill veta vad gör jag.

Säg inte det kann du åka i fängelse för, för det skiter jag i (jag är ju 
bara 13 år) En sak till hur skall jag hacka mig in på min olidliga kommpis 
Crycks dator?

Jag kan ge dig lite hjälp på att svara på frågan. 
Jag vet hanns E-mail adress, den är CUDA69@toreboda.telia.mail.com

Snälla svara på mitt brev tänk inte bara vad är detta för liten fjant som

 *** Solaris for cheap 
================================================================== 
From: "phantom" <phantom@shreve.net>

You may already be aware of this but if not, I thought you would be 
interested.  Sun is offering a single client version of Solaris for personal 
use for only the price of the media, shipping and handling!!  This gives a 
few newbies (like myself) a taste of real unix/solaris on our own computer 
for practicaly NOTHING!  I pretty much threw my redhat/x-windows into the 
dusty closet.  Anyway, if you wanted to go check it out, it's at www.sun.com 
and listed under their special promotions.

Take care.

By the way, the HappyHacker org is coming a long way.  I've been following 
you guys for a while and I'm still as impressed as the day I found you all. 
I still haven't gotten involved in the wargames yet (lack of confidence I 
guess) but I plan on it very soon.  I'm just learning so much about 
networking and programming everyday that sometimes I feel like my head is 
going to explode with all this jumbled up info.  You ever feel like that?

See you in cyberland soon.

 *** Smart Browsing not so smart 
================================================================= 
From: Marquis de carvdawg <carvdawg@patriot.net>

Carolyn, 
Here's a document that I came across recently that will be of great 
interest to your readers...

http://www.interhack.net/pubs/whatsrelated/

Summary:  If you are using the 'Smart Browsing' feature of Netscape 4.06 or 
the beta of 4.5, then the URLs you visit are being reported back to a server 
on Netscape.

If this information is to be believed (you can always verify it for 
yourself) then we're in for a rude awakening.

So much for privacy, eh?  Sure, Netscape can say what they want, but me, 
I'd rather NOT have 'Smart Browsing' if it means that EVERY URL I visit is 
reported back to, well... anyone.   Shame on you, Netscape, for taking a 
step closer to Redmond...

 *** TRINUX - A Linux Security Toolkit 
================================================================= 
Ken Williams <jkwilli2@unity.ncsu.edu>

[Dale: I picked this post up from another list - it is a really cool tool!!! 
Check it out!]

TRINUX - A Linux Security Toolkit

Trinux Developer:  M.D. Franz

What is Trinux? 
--------------- 
Trinux is a portable Linux distribution that boots from 2 HD floppies 
(or a FAT 16 partition) and runs entirely in RAM.  Trinux contains the 
latest versions of popular network security tools and is useful for 
mapping and monitoring TCP/IP networks.  Trinux allows you to transform 
an ordinary x86 PC into a powerful network [security] management 
workstation without modifying the existing hardware or operating system. 
The default configuration of Trinux supports a number of popular network 
interface cards as well as DHCP. Additional features and hardware 
support may be added through kernel modules.

Current Features 
---------------- 
Intel 486 or compatible with at least 16MB of RAM.  Kernel 2.0.34. 
Built-in support for 3Com 509/589/900, ne2000, epic100 NIC cards.  IP 
firewalls, masquerading, and aliasing.  Includes a complete set of 
tools for remote information gathering including connect() scan, SYN 
scan, FIN scan, SNMP scan, RPC, NFS, as well and DNS queries and zone 
transfers.  Several high quality sniffers for capturing network headers 
and data complete the package.  Nearly a half-dozen curses-based 
network monitors are provided to provide the clearest picture of your 
network.  The network interface may be manually configured or use 
Microsoft of ISC DHCP.

 *** Another trojan found 
================================================================= 
From: <yruno2@usa.net>

Hi again Carolyn,

Seems I have stumbled upon another almost identical trojan horse like the 
icqrevenge I wrote about before.  I dont know a lot aobut this one yet, and 
it is still active.  The file is called jm-poker.zip, called "Jenny McCarthy 
strip-poker" (a friend got it, not me... I swear!) The program file which is 
installed is called OCE.EXE.  This one also connects to the irc, and logs 
you into a channel, and it is a bit more sophisticated than icqrevenge 
(although writtin in VB).  It also downloads files from a geocities account, 
which I haven't determined what their use is yet.

Anyway, wanted to give a heads-up, and warn you users in case they were 
looking to play some poker with Jenny one time, they probably have this 
running on their machine, and are vulnerable to snooping.  I would assume 
this one also installs in the auto-run section of the registry, so search 
for oce.exe and delete the key.

I'll send more info as soon as I dig it out.

YRUno2

[Dale: A friend of yours got it, eh? OK, sure... I'd personally enjoy a game 
of strip poker with Jenny (if she is reading this she should feel free to 
email me to set a date and time), but I don't think it would be fair to 
frighten her that way!]

 *** Editorial: Infowar - Male-Only Sport? 
================================================================== 
From: Dale Holmes <editor@techbroker.com>

I recently attended the InfoWarCon 98 in Crystal City, VA. It was a great 
con. I met lots of people and saw many interesting things. The conference 
was attended by hundreds of people from around the world.

I got there very early so that I could get myself oriented with the place 
before it started to get crowded, and so that I could get a good spot to 
watch the goings on... I started on the coffee about 6:30 am, and found a 
nice corner where I could watch the room fill up. And it did fill up. By the 
time the keynote addresses began, around 8:30 am, the conference was 
starting to get packed. As I looked around the room, I saw something that 
startled me a little. The room was filled with middle-aged men, in blue 
suits, with close cropped hair and tight lips.

There they were, hundreds of them, like the IBM drones in an old Macintosh 
TV commercial I saw in the 80's. I started to feel uncomfortable, and I 
started to wonder: Where are the women?

I scanned to room again, this time looking specifically for females. 
"There's one... there's another... hmmm... wait, there's another" I started 
to say to myself out loud. "Another what?" asked the guy sitting next to me. 
"Another woman", I answered. He started to scan the room with me. Together 
we counted 14 women in attendence. There might have been more women 
registered for the conference, I have not seen the registration statistics, 
but throughout the day, I can honestly say that I did not see them. And 
that's too bad, because some of the women that were there were *FAR AND 
AWAY* the most knowledgeable people at the conference.

Two women in particular stood out during the conference: Rhonda MacLean, 
Senior VP of Security for NationsBank, and Delores Quade from Network Flight 
Recorder. Both of these women gave presentations that were substantive and 
focused. They presented their material with authority, and left the audience 
more informed than they were at the start. Compare that with the 
presentation on Middle East Info Warfare from Ariel Sobleman, which was 
embarrassingly bad, factless, and uninteresting, and it became clear that 
these women had something special.

Rhonda MacLean gave a speech on the Future of Banking Finance as a Critical 
Infrastructure, and brought to light many of the issues that the finance 
industry is wrestling with in the information age, and also how that 
industry is handling those issues. As she spoke, you got the feeling that 
she had her shirt sleeves rolled up, and was right there in the trenches 
every day. She spoke from experience, and it showed. She handled questions 
from the audience with ease, and was not thrown when a man from the audience 
repeatedly tried to back her into a corner and force her to disclose 
potentially embarrasing statistics. The assumptions of that person were in 
error, and she took no pause in saying so.

Delores Quade represented Network Flight Recorder in the Live Attacks and 
Detection session of InfoWarCon 98. She was called to the conference at the 
last minute, and was forced to work from someone else's presentation, but 
still managed to give a speech that was informative and technical in nature, 
not filled with marketing fluff and hype. She didn't try to play on the 
fears of the members of the audience - she never once mentioned Back Orifice 
- she just represented her company's product for what it is. She too spoke 
from experience, and left the room with a strong impression of her, her 
company, and the Network Flight Recorder product.

I was dissapointed to see so few women at the conference, but I was highly 
impressed by the women I did see there. Hopefully this is an emerging trend. 
If these women are any indication of the future - look out guys. It is time 
to get off your butts and get serious about your work!
