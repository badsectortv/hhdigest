Recently I found a site online that acts as an online betting 
agency.  The servers are located in Barbados the company is based out 
of Las Vegas.  On their site they offer $1000.00 to anyone who can 
alter the results or account balances of anyone on their server. 
Well I could always use a $1000.00 but I was wondering.

1.) This is an international hack to Barbados what are the laws 
concerning this?.

2.) Does their post constitute permission or do I need to contact 
them in advance and pre arrange written permission.

3.) If they do give me permission and I don't do any phone phreaking 
in the process of hacking them, what other laws will I probably be 
breaking?

Anyway just trying to work and stay out of the pen in the process. 
P.S. Happy hacker is one of the best things to hit the newbie 
community.  Thanks for the taking the risks and putting in the time.

(Moderator: If I wanted to both get some sick entertainment and shut down an 
Internet gambling outfit -- oh, yes, I think gambling is a nasty ripoff of 
the math-challenged -- guess what I would do? I would use a good IP spoofer 
to  hack their Web site and put in a message saying "Pleeeze hack our 
gambling site! Steal money from us! Screw up our accounts! We'll luv ya for 
it. Honest!" Then guys with guns with silencers will pay their visits to the 
clueless newbie hackers they catch breaking into their computers. I'll get 
away clean. Fortunately, however, I'm not that kind of a woman. So to live 
long and prosper DON"T HACK THEIR SITE!!!! In general, I figure that unless 
I have a signed, notarized contract to hack a site, I'm not going to risk 
the many, MANY kinds of trouble lurking there.)

Subject: Cyber Sitter!!!!!!

Here's how to 'hack' Cyber sitter.

In the Windows Directory, edit the field Cy.alt (or something like that) in 
Notepad.  This file contains all the violations made.  Only took 5 mins to 
work out, and that was only as long as it took me to open all the 
Cybersitter files in notepad!  They take kids for fools (So I'm slightly 
older than the 15 year old kids whom this would appeal to).

Subject: Beginner's Hole...

Hey all,

I'm tired of lurking and want to make sure that the 
Spookys out there MAKE a file on me if they don't 
already have one.

Here is something to think about the next time you 
see an office full of Win95 crap boxes running Word. 
In the last version I played with (6.0), it was 
possible to sneak into any users "personal Documents" 
folder through the file open box.  I tried this on 
a remote drive whose personal docs folder was not shared.

For a little background,  a guy in our office was 
wasting a lot of time and office resources on his 
own "consulting work".  We knew he was using the 
office software for his own business.  He was tying 
up phone lines, distracting people with BS about 
vapor-tech, and basically a pain.  My manager and I 
wanted to get the poop on what he was doing, and get 
some proof that he was improperly using company time 
and resources.  His machine was on and logged into 
the network, and the kicker was that he was USING it 
while we did this hack.

He wasn't using word.  We started up his copy of word, and hit 
File: Open.  Popped up to the network level, and hit his 
machine.  We noticed that, even though normal surfing 
(i.e. File manager) would NOT show us the personal 
docs folder, his word over the network would.  We got 
a  good look at everything, and saved copies on our 
machine (even the passworded ones were copyable). 
The poop we needed was there, and we filed it away for 
future use.

I know it's a "lame" hack, but it was fun cuz we were 
looking at things this guy KNEW he didn't want seen, 
KNEW was incriminating, and KNEW would get him in trub. 
For a paranoiac, his knowledge of how to keep things a 
secret sucked. 
It also might lead you to some other ways that the 
Godzilla of OS's fails in it's claim of security, and 
take steps to make sure you can plug up the holes.

here are answers to some of the latest posts :

congratulations for *FINALLY* discovering RFC's and welcome to the world 
of -real- hacking (read 'learning as much as possible')

to Enrique F Azuara who wants to know what log files to erase, 
wmtp, umtp and lastlog would be a good start...

(Moderator's note: erasing these files is destroying evidence, in itself a 
crime. Trust me, erasing or altering these is not enough to keep you from 
getting caught.)

Subject: answers (continued)

to intervention@imt.net : 
they look like *nix systems (Unix, Linux, BSD,...) No wonder default 
passwords don't work, no one uses them anymore. If I were you I'd try 
port 25 for remote sendmail exploits, getting an account if it's your 
university for local exploits, checking directories that are being 
exported if they have NFS/NIS,...

to burncy@mail1.nai.net : 
no no no finger doesn't bring you up the user's password (that'd be too 
good to be true...) It just gives you info about that user, thus giving 
you clues about what his password MIGHT be. Sorry you'll have to try 
harder...

and finally to you Carolyn : 
the exploits idea is good but you may have noticed there's no actual 
code in the posts. I don't care I get them through Bugtraq just like you 
but I doubt the newbies that go around asking how to hack will figure 
out how to code an exploit from the info you give... :-)

One last thought : I used to think of myself as a newbie but after 
months of intensive reading and collecting exploits all over the net I 
realized that when true hackers talk about stuff I actually understand 
what they're talking about and I could answer most of the questions in 
Happy Hacker...Could it be ...? YES ! I have finally evolved from the 
status of newbie hacker wannabe to intermediate hacker ! Reading books 
does pay after all !!! :-) 
P.S.: I know nobody cares but I just felt like letting everyone know ...

actually, by "cat it through more" he meant "cat /etc/services | more".  But 
it won't make a difference, except in helping you to understand Unix.  Also, 
I have never seen less (much better than more, but not as good as most <G>) 
on anything but a Linux box.

 In general, you should also *edit* the logfiles, but *D*O*N*'*T* completely 
remove them.  You can find the names of the system logfiles on many Unixes 
by viewing /etc/syslog.conf.  The simplest way to do this is to record the 
time you start hacking their system, since loglines are always dated and 
timed. 
Note that if their are entries like a.b <TABS> @hostname, and you cannot 
hack into @hostname, it is likely best to not modify any of the logs, unless 
their is something auth., or security., or >.notice.  (Read man syslog if you 
didn't understand that)

--- James Mastros

(Moderator: many logging programs save your log file in memory and then 
write it to disk after you log off of the system. So you're still in 
trouble. Hint: *part* of the solution is to figure out how to log on in such 
a way that there will be no logging at all of your visit. Galf knows how to 
do that. But it's against the law. One of these days the FBI file on galf 
will get big enough for a bust. Think about it, galf, how come we knew so 
much about your hack even though you logged on to the Happy Hacker majordomo 
server box in such a way that there was no shell logging? )

In your /etc/resolv.conf, add "nameserver nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn".  If you don't 
already have a /etc/resolv.conf, you should also have a "domain your.isp." 
(note the trailing dot) in the file.

Yeha, don't.  Generally, if their is anything worth getting at a BBS, the 
best way to get to it is to UPLOAD good stuff.  If you have warez to upload, 
send a e-mail with an attachment to the SysOp, do not upload it to a public 
forum, which can result in legal damage to the SysOp of the BBS in question.

That looks like it should be /etc/usr/bin.  Note that Unix uses slashes, 
                             ^   ^   ^ 
rather than back-slashes like DOS or colons like MacOS (yeech!).  Also, 
under every Unix I have ever seen, the password file is /etc/passwd or 
/etc/shadow-password.

Hey folks,

New guy here just wondering does anyone know how to get around the stupid 
password on the screen saver for WIN 95 WITHOUT hitting CTRL + ALT + DEL??

Thanks 
Tony

(Moderator: think boot disk. If that doesn't work, power down, restart, hit 
escape and make sure the bios is set to boot from a: drive. Folks, that 
Win95 password is a fragile way to save you from someone with physical 
access to your box!)

Subject: BBSes

Ok... 
 Since this is my 1st post, I'd like to say, "Hey!" to everyone out there. 
Now, the main question i have is does anyone have ANY tips on hacking 
WildCat!, TeleGuard, or Renegade BBSes? I know for a fact that Renegade 
BBSes are relatively simple, but tips always help. ;) 
 The following is a tip for anyone else interested in hacking BBSes; and 
from experience i KNOW this helps... 
    1) First, get a copy (Shareware -or- Registered version) and set 
 it up on your computer. 
    2)  Next, make sure that it's installed properly, and logon to it 
 locally. (Ya'll should know what that means) 
    3)  After your logged on, DON'T use SYSOPs or whatever YOUR 
        "SuperUser" account is, and try hacking it and dropping to DOS. 
This is a VERY good way to practice hacking into a board...BUT DO NOT 
TRY HACKING YOUR BOARD WITH VIRII, ANSI-BOMBS, etc. So don't say i didn't 
warn ya!!!!  I'd appreciate any responses/flaming of what I've stated 
above. Until then...later......  ;)

Subject: Electronic Funds Transfer without stealing PIN/TAN

The Berlin newspaper "Tagespiegel" reports on 29 Jan 97 about a television show 
broadcast the previous evening on which hackers from the Chaos Computer Club 
demonstrated how to electronically transfer funds without needing a PIN 
(Personal Identification Number) or TAN (Transaction Number).

Apparently it suffices for the victim to visit a site which downloads an ActiveX 
application, which automatically starts and checks to see if Quicken, a popular 
financial software package that also offers electronic funds transfer, is on the 
machine.  If so, Quicken is given a transfer order which is saved by Quicken in 
its pile of pending transfer orders.  The next time the victim sends off the 
pending transfer orders to the bank (and enters in a valid PIN and TAN for 
that!)  all the orders (= 1 transaction) are executed -> money is transferred 
without the victim noticing!

The newspaper quotes various officials at Microsoft et al expressing 
disbelief/outrage/"we're working on it".  We discussed this briefly in class 
looking for a way to avoid the problem.  Demanding a TAN for each transfer is 
not a solution, for one, the banks only send you 50 at a time, and many small 
companies pay their bills in bunches.  Having to enter a TAN for each 
transaction would be quite time-consuming.  Our only solution would be to forbid 
browsers from executing any ActiveX component without express authorization, but 
that rather circumvents part of what ActiveX is intended for.

A small consolation:  the transfer is trackable, that is, it can be determined 
at the bank to which account the money went.  Some banks even include this 
information on the statement, but who checks every entry on their statements...
