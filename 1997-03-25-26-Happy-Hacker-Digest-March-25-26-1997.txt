From: " john  smith" <outfield@hotmail.com>

Iw Was in a 'chat forum' the other day, and something i ve never seen 
before happened. Someone entered the forum with NO I.S.P. numbers or 
identification?(nothing, not a thing, blank space!)

How the heck did he do this ? Are there site s on the web that will 
strip away your I.S.P. identification?

If anyone knows how this is done, I would be most grateful if they 
would share the info.

Thanks in advance.

the annex is a remote access product sold by Bay Networks, actually if 
what you say is true, you should see a prompt like "annex:" or 
something, try hitting ctrl-A which by default is called an attention 
key that serves to change from session to session and create several 
jobs. if you get to the "annex:" prompt, try typing  "su" and the 
password will be the same IP as the annex, well this only works if 
they left the default. After that you should see a "annex#" prompt and 
that means you are in !! you have telnet and other stuff to play with, 
and actually you could fake your traces, but i'll get into that once 
you get to enter (i=B4ll mail the details). What's the IP of the annex 
anyway??

***   Datapac 
=====================================================================

From: Fred <fredr@sympatico.ca>

Hey,

    Regarding the discussion on x25 networks, you might wanna try the 
prefix or DNIC(Data Network Identifier Code) 3020 which is for 
Canada's Datapac. 
    An interesting one used to be 302085701427 which accepts reverse 
charge and is a Gandalf Xmux console for the NRC(National Research 
Console) with the obvious password of NRC. It is to low access 
password which will let you look without being able to modify 
anything. 
    It should still work. I haven't been on any x25 network in ages 
but it had been working for many years.

>hi happy hackers,

>I have a question , has any one every used `Claymore` to attack a

>to set it up.

In regards to the second half of the post in regards to using 
claymore to recover the password for and excel file. Anyway Im really 
not sure about how or if you could do it with claymore but I have seen 
a program that supposebly will recover a password from and excel file 
you can find it at "http://www.hiwaay.net/bokler/bsw_crak.html" even 
so I think it is expensive shareware. A cheaper alternative is if you 
have access to a compiler you could write your own brute force type 
program. The following is a not so pretty example of one, I wrote real 
quick after reading the post. It is in Visual Basic, it works, and it 
is pretty fast but their is not a real good method to stop it as of 
yet after it gets the password. The last two lines of the do loop will 
do the job most of the time but it has failed a couple of times. 
Anyway you need to create one form with two command buttons on it, and 
the rest should be obvious. Be for you run it you need to open excel 
or it won't work.

It's just that linux doesn't recognise your network card... 
Your problem is that the 3COM 3c509 card is a Plug and play device and 
linux doesn't care about most pnp devices. What you have to do is 
disable the pnp feature of this card from the dos configuration 
program on the 3com disk set, and assign it good port,irq & memory 
address. After that, linux should recognize it very well... Hum, may 
be you'll have to recompile your kernel with new setting in the 
network part... (i don't remember)...

I'm not exactly sure how to do it in Netscape but I believe in IE you 
can do it with the "Internet Explorer Administration Kit" from 
Microsoft. It's made for ISP's and companies that want to customize 
their version of IE. You can get it from Microsoft's web page 
somewhere, but you have to provide information about your company to 
download it.

Now, if there's another way to do it w/o the Admin Kit, I'd really 
like to know.

Hope this helps.

*** /etc/passwd info 
=====================================================================

From: anonymous

Please make this anonymous

A question about password files:

 In many password files, everything is shadowed. However in 
some, the passwords aren't. Except for the accounts like adm, sys, and 
bin. I can understand this; a hacker could do anything with these 
accounts. However, root isn't shadowed. Why is this? It's beem like 
this in every unshadowed password file I've seen (which isn't a lot, 
but I'm definately seeing a trend). It doesn't make much sense. 
 Is there any way to see if a password file that you have is 
correct and up to date besides simply logging on with it. This is 
obviously ILLEGAL, and the host can tell where you're calling from. 
People have posted that there are ways to do this anonymously, but 
nobody's posted what they are. 
 One last thing: Can somebody please post what the parts of the 
pw file are or give me a url where I can find it? Thanks.

===================================================================== 
*** phf bug 
===================================================================== 
 

From: ae630@pgfn.bc.ca (Tim Gutteridge) 
 

What are some of the other commands that you can do through the 
phf bug? Can you do any command anywhere in UNIX? And can you get the 
shadow file from a host in the same way as you can get the shadowed 
password file (by replacing the passwd at the end with shadow)? It 
hasn't worked for me, but I can't see why. Maybe the hosts I've tried 
have used different directories.

For some reason, you can't use this bug through anonymizer. Does 
anybody know of any anonymous web surfers that let you? You would be 
able to do almost anything on a computer, while normally the computer 
can see where the password is being sent to. This seems dangerous.

A good way to find sites to try this bug on is to use yahoo. 
Search for something like http://www.au, and you will get a listing of 
url's near the other end of the earth, where it is safest to do this 
sort of thing. Once you get a password file that isn't shadowed, the 
best cracker to use is John the Ripper. You can download it and some 
wordlists from Silicon Toad's web site.

Feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions on this type of 
thing or just want to share ideas and discuss what you're doing with 
this.

Here is a quick down and dirty method for getting a look at what is 
listed in the host target's puter ; 
http://"name of server"/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/ls%20/ 
The above Phf will give you the a dir listing of everything from the 
root of the system from there you can just alter it accordingly to 
have a peek around the system to see what else you can learn :) IE; 
http://"name of server"/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/ls%20/bin 
would show you every command that is available in the bin dir and if 
you slightly modified it you would also be able to see the permissions 
of the specific files IE; 
http://"name of server"/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0a/bin/ls%20-la%20/bin 
which can come in handy since, Well seen as how you have root 
permissions you now have a nice little bit of info about how the 
system functions and can use that to get even more access or info out 
of it. Bottom Line if you run a server Ditch the PHF hack or do what 
alot of others have done and put a symbolic link or small script that 
points people to the www.apache.org Phf Candid Camera Screen You've 
Been Busted 
:-) 
So remember boys and girls play fair and hack to learn, hack to earn, 
yearn to hack, just dont crack when you hack and you will have plenty 
of fun and never have to meet Bruno or Betty in the Pen.

Happy Hacking

From: " NoOne  Uno" <mxlplx@hotmail.com>

Hi!  I just wanted to let your readers know that I found a great port 
scanner for Windows 95. The PortScanner can be found at 
http://www.blueglobe.com/~cliffmcc/portscanner.html.  It allows you to 
scan a range of IP addresses and pick which 
ports to test(you can add your own.) A listing of which ports are 
accessible is listed when finished.  The only annoying part of the 
program is the "REGISTER ME" windows that pop-up all the time.  This 
could be remedied by registering or... well thats all!  Enjoy!

***   Editing the Registry

From: "BeAvEr" <beaver11@themall.net>

I have a question.  I ws just exploring the Registry Editor to my 
wonderful Windows95, when I stumbled into something.  In the 
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" under the System folder, I found a folder called 
"PwdProvider"  Is this folder in every computer.  Because certain 
files in that folder contained encypted information about my various 
passwords to my computer.  Would it be possible for someone that 
already has access to my computer to get my various passwords?  And 
then change them?  Also, is there anyway to place a ..wav file in your 
Windows Startup Screen.  So when you boot up Windows a ..wav file will 
play with it?  I would like to thank the GTMHH Beginner issues a lot. 
It is a place for beginners to start, we all should appeciate it.  It 
is something the more experienced hackers never had.

Thank you GTMHH!  Ha.

Sometimes, sendmail can't send mail to MAILER-DAEMON. In these case, 
the message is stored in /var/tmp/dead.letter.

I have seen it appear in the following configuration :

1) sendmail on the best MX host is configured to refuse mail bigger 
   than x bytes.

2) sendmail on a lower priority MX host is configured as a null client 
   (FEATURE(nullclient)), but without the size limit.

3) a big mail (bigger than x bytes) arrives on the host where sendmail 
   is configured as a null client (the low priority MX host).

Here is what happens then:

4) the null client tries to pass the mail to the best MX, which refuse 
   it (bigger than x bytes)

5) So the null client tries to bounce back the mail to the 
   originator. Since  it is a null client, it sends the mail to the 
   best MX host.

6) But the best MX host refuses the mail (bigger than x bytes). So the 
   null client tries to send a notification to MAILER-DAEMON. Since it 
   is a null client, it sends this mail to the best MX host, which 
   refuse it (bigger than x bytes). This a case where sendmail will 
   write to /var/tmp/dead.letter.

It may exist other ways for sendmail to write in /var/tmp/dead.letter.

Is the system you are using a unix system?  if so, you wil have to 
gain root.  then find a program that removes a user from the 'wtmp' 
and 'utmp' logs.  Then go to either /var/logs or /var/messages or 
/var/spool/logs or something like that (varies from unix system to 
system), and do a grep in those files for your username, and remove 
all entries that refer to you.

This should allow you to be untracable from your end.  As for the 
other end, you would have to gain root there and do the same.  Just 
remember, you need to do a LOT of research and sniffing around a 
system to find exploits, and you have to do it in a way so you don't 
raise any flags with the sysadmin (like trying to brute force the root 
password -- stupid).

 Tis best to have an anon remailer send it to you.  If you can only 
 get the file by e-mail..  Best way to hack is use a place/computer 
 that MANY people have access to (like a library computer), and use a 
 false name if you have to sign in for it.  That way only the 
 librarian can identify you.  Otherwise you have left a digital trail 
 leading back to your machine or ISP.

Is there a way to eliminate the password box that comes on
