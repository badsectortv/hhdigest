MEINEL ANNOUNCES WAR AGAINST WEB SITES THAT OFFER EMAIL BOMBER PROGRAM DOWNLOADS 
 

Moderator: Judging from some of the email I get, lots of people think that 
boilerplate up above about this being a list for *legal* hacking think I'm 
just saying this because some lawyer told me so. No way. I'm against 
computer crime. In fact, according to some of the law enforcement people on 
this list, the things we discuss here have been helpful in teaching them how 
to make busts.

But some of you guys either don't believe me, or you think you can pull the 
wool over my eyes. So here's how I'm going to prove without a doubt which 
side I'm on.

Many of you have heard my interview on the PC World Web site 
(http://www.pcworld.com/news/newsradio/meinel/index.html). Remember how I 
said a three year old could launch an email bomb attack using certain Web 
sites?

Well, guess what, I'm not going to give out those URLs here. I figure most 
people on this list could find them really easily. And the ones who can't, 
well, I'm not going to help you do irresponsible things.

Now here's my challenge. See if you can beat me at getting those email 
bomber sites off the Web. It's something even a beginner can do.

Have you seen the Guide to (mostly) Harmless Hacking Vol. 1 No. 6 -- How to 
Nuke Offensive Webs Sites? I show the legal procedure with step-by-step 
hacking techniques for getting rid of bad news stuff. I show myself getting 
mightily tempted by a buggy Web server, but backing off and doing the right 
thing.

If you want to turbo charge your study of legal hacker techniques to cut a 
bad news Web site off from the Internet, you may add to your arsenal the 
techniques in GTMHH Vol. 3 No. 2, "How to Map the Internet."

Both these GTMHHs can be found at the Infowar site Hackers forum, 
http://www.infowar.com/cgi-shl/login.exe.

************************* 
Tip for irresponsible email bombers: not a single one of these programs will 
really truly keep you anonymous. Do you really think the programmers of 
these weapons would turn them loose and then be helpless to defend 
themselves against you guys? No way. Each of the programs has a way the 
victim can get back at you. Do you want to take that gamble? Besides, we all 
think email bombing is lame because you don't have to know anything 
whatsoever to use them.

GETTING RID OF JUNO ADS

Subject: Getting rid of Juno ads

      I tried that, and it didn't work.  I also found a method that actually 
does work though... in your Juno directory, go to subdirectory "ads", and 
delete all the numbered directories besides the first two, because they have 
the Juno logos in them and if you mess with those, Juno won't work properly. 
It would be a good idea to copy the numbered directories to another location 
before trying this because Juno may not work without it, because it seems to 
be very picky.  Do NOT try to mess with the ads, i.e. editing them so that 
they'll say something funny, because Juno will DELETE the directory where 
the ad is in.

WHERE TO FIND RFCS -- AND WHY YOU SHOULD STUDY THEM

From: k1neTiK <samk5@IDT.NET>

I have noticed that from time to time people post 
questions about where to find a list of commands for something, and don't 
know where to look.  Well, the first place to start should be a RFC.  go to 
http://www.internic.net/ds/dspg0intdoc.html, go to the RFC section, and 
search for whatever you are looking for.  Example, you want to know the 
commands for incoming Email (most often POP3), go to the page, and search 
for POP3 or POP.  Then look through the documents for one talking about POP3 
in general (you don't want a RFC detailing the specifics of a certain 
command, unless of course your researching that command.), and look for the 
section on COMMANDS.  This is easily done, and as so many hackers have 
pointed out (some in not such a polite way), it's a lot better to find 
something out for yourself than to have it "fed" right to you.

AMAZING DISCOVERY: EGG DROPS

I dunno. So, hit www.yahoo.com, search for Eggdrop. A couple of 
pages...here's a good one: http://www.foonet.net/~pepsi/f/estranged.html

>From their FAQ:

(1) WHAT IS EGGDROP?

    Eggdrop is an IRC bot, written in C.  If you don't know what IRC is, 
    this is probably not whatever you're looking for!  Eggdrop, being a 
    bot, sits on a channel and takes protective measures: to keep the 
    channel from being taken over (in the few ways that anything CAN), 
    to recognize banished users or sites and reject them, to recognize 
    privileged users and let them gain ops, etc.

    One of the more unique features of Eggdrop is its "party line", 
    accessible via DCC chat, which allows you to talk to other people 
    lag-free.  Consider it a multi-way DCC chat, or a miniature IRC 
    (complete with channels).  You can link up with other bots and 
    expand the party line until it actually becomes something very much 
    like IRC, in fact.

    Eggdrop is always being improved and adjusted because the author 
    is never really satisfied with it.  In fact, it existed for several 
    years as v0.7 - v0.9 before finally going 1.0.  A valiant effort has 
    been made to chase down and destroy bugs.  It is definitely nowhere 
    near as buggy as the ircII client.  Crashes should be rare and 
    surprising (but aren't they always? [surprising anyway]).

    This README file contains information about how to get Eggdrop, how to 
    quickly compile the bot, what you may need to do when upgrading from 
    older versions, a list of frequently asked questions about compiling, 
    how to set up a crontab, some boring legal stuff, info about the mailing 
    list (a great place to ask questions), and a complaint/explanation about 
    the lack of documentation.

    The preliminary documentation is in "eggdrop.doc" and is intended to be 
    read after you have Eggdrop compiled and set up.  It's changing all the 
    time and getting new sections added.  If you'd like to write a section 
    or just indicate some part that needs improving, please do!

    Accessing files over a public website is hardly illegal.  Should an 
admin be stupid enough to leave their passwd file freely accessible 
from their web site or have their email archive open for public 
browsing <ahem> you can hardly blame the user for looking.

    If you take active steps to circumvent the existing security of the 
site, that would probably qualify as illegal.

I want to know? What is password sniffing and how can i do it?

BTW hears and example of our password files..

Please help!!!

mojoe@wko.com

Moderator: looks like your passwords aren't being shadowed. (Shadowed means 
the encrypted passwords aren't even in the password file.) I'll bet 
2atAaGv9dtSeo is the encrypted password for your sysadmin. The temptation is 
great to run 2atAaGv9dtSeo through a password cracking program and use it to 
break into the root account and leave your sysadmin a nasty note. But that 
would be wrong. And illegal:) But I'll bet that's how your nemesis is 
running rampant on your Web page.

Subject: Hacking Novell Netware 
  
My school runs Novell Netware on it's computers.  The computers will have a 
DOS prompt, but you won't be connected to the network until you type in 
"login tty---" where --- is the login name.  My problem is, as soon as you 
do that, it runs a script and brings up some program called automenu,  Where 
it gives you a list of runable programs from the network. 
   My question is, can anyone tell me where such a script file would be held?? 
  
(Answer: 'tty---' is the user name. 
So if you type SYSCON.EXE (sys:\public\), it will give you a list of all 
the user on the Novell network. 
The script that it's running is either the system login or the user login 
script. If you want to modify the user's login script, try finding the 
SYS:\MAIL (dir)(to map yourself try - MAP O:=server\SYS:\MAIL) then just 
follow down the directories until you reach the end. There will be a 
file called LOGIN (no extension). This is the personal login script.) 
  
You can't exit from automenu without logging out.  There is a command which 
gets you out of Automenu without logging you off but you need a password for 
that. 
But the school runs WordPerfect and you have read rights and possibly Write, 
so I think I can save myself a copy of the script on a disk, without the 
command to bring up Automenu.

(Looking for the Automenu. Look for a file with the *.mn? extension) 
  
You can also run certain Win 3.11 applications though Automenu, but the RUN 
command is shaded so you can't click on it.  Can someone tell me where the 
command is located which tells the computer to shade run??

(If you look into your WIN.INI for a [RESTRICTION] section- Look for RUN=OFF 
just REM (;) that line and you should be able to use the RUN command. 
Thanx!!

WINDOWS 95 PASSWORDS ARE A JOKE!

Materva's Hideout has a link to download it.

Subject: Protected mode sucks

I just wanted to say that windows protected mode sucks.  It can be broken 
in a variety of ways; these are a few:

1) Use a boot disk. 
2) Select run from the Windows file menu and enter C:\command.com 
3) On start-up bypass the autoexec.bat files.

I may post all of the ways I know to beat windows "security" in a later 
post but  I'm short of time.

I just wanted to put out the message that protected mode is no means of 
security.

How many ways does WIN95 encrypt ur password? 
What process does WIN95 to encrypt a password?

From: Saint Waldo <stwaldo@teleport.com>

A really simple way to get rid of a windows password (if you have 
physical access) is to boot into DOS (try hitting F5 during boot up 
to see a nice boot menu), and the shuffle thru the Win95 dir looking 
for *.pwd files.  At this point, you can trash all the sharing 
passwords on a machine.  Reboot.  Set up any password you want, 
anywhere.  Make sure you add access and a password for yourself on 
the win95 hierarchy.  If that icon change on shared folders seems 
like a dead giveaway, you can use Plus to change it.

As an ethical note, messing with other peoples configs is LAME!! 
Ask your friend who got burned if they want to see this blow up 
into a war.  Since it sounds like you all are near each other 
geographically, this stuff is great fuel for a fistfight.  I'd 
just call the guy a loser, clip his net cable, and make HIM sit 
in front of your friends box during the arduous Win95 install. 
If you really want to make him squirm, tell him you want to 
have a preserved copy of DOS 6.2 on the drive as well.  Then 
ask for OS/2 and NT partitions as well.  And make 
him serve daiquiris while the installer checks the system.  Then 
you'll be 3liT3, cuz every gronk knows that Win95 is a tough 
nut to crack (I hope the sarcasm is obvious).

BTW, a Timex Sinclair running BASIC is inherently cooler than 
any Pentium Whatever running Gates' World (Parity Time, 
Excrement!).

we hack into a system without being noticed? If you don't modify anything,

Moderator: There ARE things a hacker can do other than break into computers. 
Or you could get a friend to let you try breaking into his. Or you can hack 
your own computer. But if you crack into the computer of someone who doesn't 
consent, and then you alter logs, you are making your crime worse. Also, 
systems administrators are often hackers. You don't want to find out what 
your victim sysadmin may do to you to get revenge.

you can use your Linux box as a router but I think it would imply that
