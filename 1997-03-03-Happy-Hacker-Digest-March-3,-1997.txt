*** CRACKING INFO 
===============================================================================

From: cL0ut <strider@unix.aardvarkol.com>

   First I'd like to say that the new formatting of Happy Hackers 
   Digest, is *MUCH* better, and I hope it stays like that. Next, I 
   have a question about cracking passwd files. Say I got a passwd 
   file called "shadow", am I right in assuming that's like a back-up 
   of the "passwd" file? Also, I have a sh**ty 286, 1MB RAM 'puter, 
   and I was wondering if there's a FASTER cracker other than BRUTE, 
   because I was trying to crack the file with a 2MB word list, and 
   after 7.5hrs it was STILL on "A"'s. Any suggestions and comments 
   would be appreciated...thanx.

   How fast a password cracker runs depends in part on how 
   hard the passwords are to crack. You can crack "apple" or "kiss" much 
   faster than "x4M&19cd#". Chances are you hit some of the hard ones. 
   Also, I *do* hope you had permission to crack that file. Many 
   sysadmins regularly run a password cracker on their password files so 
   they can alert users of the need to change easily cracked passwords.

   I have multiple accts at my ISP.  SO, I thought "Try to Rlogin" as 
   someone else.  I have acct "A" and acct "b"  so I (think I ) made 
   acct "a" a trusted host with "B" and vise versa.    I would try to 
   log in and it would ask for a password?  Maybe my commands were 
   wrong, I put this in the .rhosts file (I saw it somewhere on the 
   net):

               echo  "main.rgv.net maverick" >~/.rhosts 
               Domain---->^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^<-----Username

   I just saw a *.txt file that said that would work.  I want to know 
   for sure.  You don't have to TELL ME EXACTLY, just point me in the 
   direction of some *.txt's for me to read I have done SO many 
   fr****** searches for "Rlogin" stuff and cant find it!  Thanks

   But Carolyn, you more than anyone know how I want ACCURATE

   So, I will continue to critique this kind of stuff and be quite 
   mean in the process. Glad to see you are going behind me giving a 
   more friendly and accurate description.

   Since we don't know the sysadmin, we can only talk about what the 
   system will do. The system will log that telnet. No, not in the 
   shell log, but that is trivial.

   But this will not work if you get the passwd file via FTP.

   'permission denied'. Remember, the purpose of the shadow file is to 
   store the passwds so they are readable only by the admin. Since 
   /etc/passwd has to be 644 (world readable), the need for a more 
   secure storage came about.  This is very simple.

   Sometimes. If you are one for rumors... GALF sat on the server of a 
   well known security expert for over 6 months without being 
   detected. It is not easy to do that, especially on smaller systems 
   with a handful of user accounts.

   Most good hackers share the ethics of not being malicious toward 
   other hackers, and tend to not help the feds in any matter. Also 
   consider ALL the details of who GALF has hacked, and why. In most 
   cases I have seen it was simply an action/reaction response to 
   previous events.

   So if it is so simple, why hasn't he been caught yet? Or u4ea? Or 
   Angry Johnny? Or...

Moderator: 
  
   I'm keeping my mouth shut on Angry Johnny because he's 
   been a publicity goldmine for me. Look at the mistake John Markoff 
   made. Once Kevin Mitnick came to trial everyone realized that super 
   reporter Markoff was full of baloney.  So I need Angry Johnny to 
   stay in hiding. Don't get caught, please?

   As for GALF, that team used to strike everyone who said anything 
   bad about Netta Gilboa. I don't agree that opposing Gilboa should 
   be punished with wiping system files. In my case, GALF goofed. Some 
   jokester posted an alleged attack by me on Gilboa to a hacker 
   bulletin board, and GALF went on the war path against me. You see 
   the results -- now I attack Gilboa at every opportunity. In fact, 
   GALF has become such a joke that lots of people are attacking 
   Gilboa just to have fun seeing what kind of attack GALF does next.

   If any of you readers want the excitement of dueling with GALF, the 
   best place to go to incite attacks is to post to the dc-stuff list 
   (subscribe by emailing majordomo@dis.org with message "subscribe 
   dc-stuff.") Also, GALF guys attend every def con convention taking 
   notes on who says bad things about Netta.

From: Iggy Drougge <optimus@canit.se>

   A Michael Oztosomething or other was telneting around, when he 
   found a thing which wanted you to type "cli". What he got into was 
   an Annex server, used by many ISPs and other Internet hosts. They 
   are known for their security, which I'm inclined to agree with, 
   since they don't run exploitable services, but only let you log on, 
   and from there run arbitrary commands, such as rlogin, telnet, slip 
   and ppp. They are mostly used to answer modems, or as a single port 
   to all machines on a network, where telnetting to the machines is 
   not allowed from the outside.

   On another note, Carolyn had problems deciphering the Swedish 
   someone posted to the list. It seems like the person who did so was 
   not aware of being subscribed to the list, he was wondering whether 
   it was some reading practice for his forthcoming English test. =/

   BTW, what is a narc?

Moderator:

   This is an ancient term belying the Yippie/hippie origins of 
   hackerdom. Back in the 1960s "narc" was slang for an undercover 
   agent enforcing narcotics laws. Then around 1970 the big thing for 
   hippies was learning to phone phreak. In fact the Youth 
   International Party (Yippies), founded by Abbie Hoffman, began 
   putting out a magazine called the "Technical Assistance Program" 
   (TAP) with technical details on phreaking. Since these guys were 
   already heavy into illegal drugs, it was natural to call the people 
   who tried to catch phone fraudsters "narcs." Then as computer 
   hacking began to be criminalized, the term "narc" spread to 
   computer crime detectives.

From: " Intergalactic  <--" <intergalactic@hotmail.com>

   Awhile back, Bronc Buster posted an exploit for BSD. (the exploit 
   consisted of ftp'ing to the local host, suspending the job with a 
   [ctrl]+[z], then doing a kill -11 on that job and returning to the 
   foreground, thereby creating a core dump which contains encrypted 
   passwd's). After experimenting on a couple different systems, I 
   have found this will work on OSF 1 as well. Is anyone here familiar 
   with John the Ripper? If you are, I was wondering: How does the 
   -single mode work? What is it doing? I didn't get any of the docs 
   with the copy I had, but the -single mode seems to work on roughly 
   1 out of 20 passwd files. I always thought the you HAD to have a 
   wordlist for a cracking program to work, but John in -single mode 
   does not use one.

   hmmmm....a Unix hacking tutorial...let's take a look : 
   - "how to cover your tracks" : yeah right what about wmtp, umtp, 
     logs,...?  not typing in any parameters ain't gonna save 
     you...the moment you log into a computer, whatever the login and 
     password, your IP address goes to the log...

   - "how to get the password file" : anonymously ftp to a site and 
     get /etc/passwd ? no offense but have you ever run a Linux or 
     Unix server ?  in case you hadn't noticed the passwd file in the 
     /etc directory is actually in /home/ftp/etc . That's right, it's 
     not the REAL passwd, just a stripped down version of it. Most of 
     the time all the privileged accounts are locked out and they 
     don't have many user logins and passwords.

   - "shadowed password files" : when the password file has a * in the 
     password field it does NOT mean the password is shadowed, it 
     means it's been locked out (read useless, it's like it's not 
     there). It does makes sense though that you don't know it (or 
     maybe you did ?) if you think that all the password files you've 
     probably ever seen come from /home/ftp/etc (no offense here...).

From: anonymous

   OK, I have a question. Lets say you want access to a system (it 
   happens to be System V release 4.0) that is not run by a bunch a 
   w***** that left a default user/pass. There is FTP access, but the 
   password file is of course shadowed (x's in place of encrypted 
   passwords). I try to "get /etc/shadow" like suggested and it says 
   no such file. Now what.  Unshadow.c seems useless since I need to 
   be logged in to run it on there machine. You can run and compile 
   from anon. FTP. Can some post a way to gain access to such servers 
   (which are almost all servers on the net these days, no one leave 
   defaults in place if they have half a brain...)

   Oh gno! More conspiracy theories!#@$!

   Status: foobar.com was sold to a company in MA that wanted the 
   name. I have since registered sekurity.org which will be up soon. I 
   am currently waiting on a second ISDN adapter (the first has no 
   Unix support). As for the 'crash', it had nothing to do with any 
   user. It had everything to do with me running that wily 'fdisk' 
   program after upgrading. The new system has just under 5 gigs in 
   hard drives, 10 gigs in jaz, 128 megs of RAM, and of course the 
   ISDN. Once it is back up, Carolyn is more than welcome to attack 
   again. And as I have said before, I will not send a notarized

   that is required for that contract. However, this is at least the 
   10th time I have posted to the list saying it is OK. If that isn't 
   good enough, oh well. I already had enough fun with the old systems 
   and keeping people out. The new system will most likely be a bigger

From: alma34 <root@ozemail.com.au>

   Since discovering the system I mentioned in a previous digest I 
   have come to understand showmount as being a very powerful tool for 
   would-be hackers to discover whether a system is hackable.. So to 
   illuminate you sysadmins who I know DO leave entire file systems 
   mountable by EVERYONE as to why you shouldn't, and also to show 
   hackers how such hacks can be accomplished..

   BTW.. This type of insecurity is increasingly rare but it's more 
   common than finding a unshadowed passwd file in the ftp /etc 
   directory..

   First lets look at using the command. From your shell prompt type..

   [/root]# showmount -e targethost 
   Export list for targethost: /cdrom (everyone) / (everyone)

   If this is the case you've hit paydirt.. and sysadmins if you run 
   this on your system and it comes up the same you're in deeep 
   doo-doo. What a hacker could then do is the following..

   [/root]#mkdir /hack 
   [/root]#mount targethost:/etc /hack 
   [/root]#cd /hack 
   [/hack]#vi passwd...

   And so on.. A hacker could get in and edit the passwd file.. 
   enabling a disable account.. increasing his own to uid of 0 
   decrease roots to 500, etc.. This is a very dumb setup for 
   targethost. However you may have received the following from your 
   showmount query.

   [/root]# Export list for targethost: 
             / stupid.targethost /var/spool/lpd  (everyone)

   So you say to yourself.. "hmm, targethost is exporting everything 
   to stupid.targethost (another computer on its network..) lets try 
   that one out..

   [/root]#showmount -e stupid.targethost 
         Export list for stupid.targethost: / (everyone)

   And once again you've hit paydirt... However when you looked at the 
   passwd file their was only two accounts.. Of course you don't fuck 
   with them so you create or enable one. But when you login with that 
   account..

   [/root]#rlogin -l test stupid.targethost test 
   login not allowed on this terminal..

   Login:

   Hmmm.. you're not allowed to login with that. So you try some other 
   ones but you get the same result. Is it unhackable..? By no means.. 
   But what you'll have to do is play with the actual enabled 
   accounts. Do a more of the passwd file. and write down the 
   encrypted passwd.. 78hkjkHlj or something.. Then carefully delete 
   it and increase the uid to 0. If you don't know what field to do 
   this in then I won't tell you.. figure it out yourself.. Then login 
   in with the account.

   [/root]#rlogin -l user stupid.targethost

   Welcome to stupid.targethost!

   [/user]#

   Now you should remember that targethost was exporting "/" to 
   stupid.targethost. So now that you have root privileges you create 
   a temporary directory and..

   [/user]#mkdir /temp 
   [/user]#mount targethost:/etc /temp 
   [/user]#cd /temp 
   [/temp]#vi passwd.. 
   [/temp]#cp passwd /user 
   [/user]#exit

   Then the hacker would need to replace the encrypted passwd in its 
   EXACT form otherwise it will be noticed.. You should also put in 
   the correct uid otherwise someone will notice a # where they 
   shouldn't. Of course this should always be done when no-on is on 
   the system.. or someone's been idle for over a few hours.. Late at 
   night's always a good idea.

   A hacker could put in various backdoors to ensure future access.. 
   To read up on what backdoors exist (there are heaps!) go to:

   http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/3498/security.htm

   A hacker would then have complete control of your system. However 
   if he wasn't smart he/she would be easy to notice. I hope this has 
   illustrated to you sysadmins that mounting you systems is a very 
   dangerous practice unless the proper precautions are in place.. 
   Tripwire is a good one to detect changes in file such as passwd. 
   However that can be gotten around easily too. I suggest all 
   sysadmins and security consultants check their systems immediately 
   to detect whether the problem exists..

   Of course if you received the following responce from showmount 
   when you queried a system...

   mount clntudp_create: RPC: Port mapper failure - RPC: Unable to 
   receive

   or..

   mount clntudp_create: RPC: Program not registered

   Then you would have some difficulty in attacking targethost with 
   this method.. Also a hacker would be smart to change his default 
   shell to disable history logging, as well as modify various other 
   accounting logs..

   A few other off topic things..

   I would like to apologize to Betty from Infowar for kicking her off 
   #hackers. I acted in a totally f***** elitist manner and I 
   apologize for it.

   Another thing is that I am currently compiling a FAQ for #hackers 
   as well as a webpage. Any submissions, help, comments, or 
   criticisms are welcomed.  Please send 'em to warpy@null.net.

   Last thing... Could we please see some more FEMALE hackers on 
   #hackers. I don't believe that the majority of hackers are made up 
   of adolescent boys.. And it would be encouraging to see some Unix 
   proficient females apart from our illustrious moderator...

   That's about all for now... adios!

   I'm not sure what you are trying to say here.  Why would any 
   sysadmin create a ftp account for the id games ?  And if they did, 
   why would they not put a password on it ?  FTP servers usually use 
   their own passwd file ( as set up by the sysadmin ), not the main 
   system passwd file.  The FTP passwd file will only contain id's for 
   valid ftp logins.

   All the above does is spit out the contents of the passwd file. 
   You can do as much by typing 'cat /etc/passwd'.

   Assuming you didn't get root:

      Usually only readable by root.  So, you would not be able to 
      look at it.

   >          cat /etc/passwd

   Which, if it's shadowed, would avail you nothing.

      Which would trigger the perror on my system.  utmp is not world 
      writable and trying to open it read/write would fail.  So, you 
      are still listed in utmp, now what ?  Of course, if you have 
      root access, hiding your tracks becomes almost trivial ( almost 
      due to programs like tripwire).

   True, PHF is a bad cgi program.  However, any sysadmin worth the 
   name also knows this and has already deleted it.  In fact, several 
   of the "stock" cgi scripts that come with some web server 
   distributions are vulnerable.  Again these are well known and 
   usually removed.

   A '*' in the passwd field means that the account cannot be used for 
   login.  Many applications require their own user and/or group id 
   and the '*' helps ensure that users do not log on with these 
   accounts.  Of course, some buffer overflow exploits will drop a 
   user into a shell with the uid/gid of the program that was running 
   ;-) .

   Again, you are counting on a sysadmin being careless and leaving 
   these backups lying about where you can look at them.  Most shadow 
   passwd files are only readable by root, or at most, an 
   administrative group.

   One interesting tidbit about pine.  If you decide you want to 
   advertise your presence and piss of the user whose identity you've 
   assumed, just run pine while he/she has it up.  Pine will change 
   their session to read-only and you will be given write access. :-)

   As root, you can do anything.  However, a lot of systems do not

   to login as root ).  As a user, you can only play with stuff 
   that the user has access to.  If the sysadmin is in the least 
   bit security conscious, it'll take a bit of work and ingenuity 
   to get higher access.

   I can see this being the case on a large site.  But on a smaller 
   site ( less than 50 or so users ) there is a good chance that the 
   sysadmin will be more likely to recognize a login name that he/she 
   did not authorize.  Personally, if I see someone on the system that 
   I do not recognize, I try and track them down ( it's good exercise 
   if nothing else <g> ).

   Hmmm.  I wouldn't risk my freedom on this.  But, if you are not 
   doing anything immediately damaging, the sysadmin may elect to just 
   watch and see what you are doing.  Who knows, you could 
   accidentally point out more security holes to him/her. :-)

   Really ?  My logs would show this.

   As soon as you let them know you are there, you will lose access 
   very quickly.  Of course, if the above exploits gave you access in 
   the first place, the sysadmin is so f*****d up that you could 
   probably leave yourself a few back doors and they wouldn't likely 
   find them. :-)

   The above is absolutely correct.  Hacking is not running nifty 
   little programs or tricks, it's knowledge.  Knowing the system 
   better ( or at least as good ) as the people who run it is the sign 
   of a hacker. :-)

   P.S. - I do not consider myself a hacker as I still have a lot to 
   learn.

   In response to what you said about Linux being hacker-friendly, I 
   would just like to say that the BeOS for Macintoshes is supposedly 
   the most hacker-friendly OS for the common desktop machine.  It's 
   UNIX based, which probably contributes to its value.  The NextStep 
   OS is supposedly almost as hacker-friendly, and I have heard from 
   numerous sources that Apple will do the smart thing and make a 
   version for Intel compatible machines.

   Alas, the NeXt operating system is a hackers' paradise because it 
   has so many hackable holes...
