COURT DECLARES SPAMMING TO BE COMPUTER CRIME!

[A] federal judge in Ohio declared that bulk mail sent by Cyber Promotions 
Inc. to CompuServe subscribers amounts to computer trespassing.

CompuServe, of Columbus, Ohio, filed suit against Cyber Promotions last 
year, saying that its host computers were bogged down with junk e-mail, 
and that subscribers were complaining bitterly about having to sift 
through their electronic mailboxes while the meter was running on their 
CompuServe accounts.

"CompuServe is entitled to restrict access to its private property," U.S. 
District Judge James L. Graham of Ohio ruled Monday. He issued an order 
that prohibits Cyber Promotions from sending its electronic advertisements 
to any of CompuServe's estimated 5 million members.  Wallace, who said he 
mails out about 1.8 million e-mail messages a day for 7,000 clients, said 
CompuServe had a much larger target than Cyber Promotions.

"CompuServe wanted to set a precedent so they could stop other companies 
from sending commercial e-mail, and they got what they wanted," he said.

In his 32-page order, Graham reflected the complaints of many Internet 
users by writing, "High volumes of junk e-mail devour computer processing 
and storage capacity, slow down data transfer between computers... and 
cause recipients to spend time and money wading through messages that they 
do not want."

Subject: AOL-Cyberpomo settlement: Spamford's butt kicked again 
Forwarded-by: jstron1@umbc.edu (strong john)

(The first article is the AOL version of the judgement, and the following 
article is Spamford's spin on it.)

AOL Wins Federal Court Order to Protect Members from Junk E-mail

In a win for its 8 million members, AOL secured a federal court order 
prohibiting CyberPromotions from circumventing members tools meant to 
block junk e-mail.  The order, which comes one day after another federal 
court in Ohio ruled against CyberPromotions, will prevent CyberPromotions 
from sending unsolicited e-mail to AOL members who don't want to receive 
it.  The order goes into effect Friday.

"This decision is another big win for AOL members because it puts them in 
control of their e-mail," according to David Phillips, AOL's Associate 
General Counsel.  "They can still receive CyberPromotions junk e-mail if 
they want; but most members don't, and CyberPromotions is now legally 
bound to respect their wishes.

"Cyberspace consumers are fed up with junk e-mail and AOL leads the 
industry in giving its members tools like PreferredMail to help them enjoy 
the interactive experience.  This victory validates AOL's PreferredMail 
tool and underscores the added value consumers receive when they use AOL."

                 CYBER PROMOTIONS VS. AOL SETTLED 
  
  Feb 4, 1997 - Philadelphia -  The lawsuit between Cyber 
 Promotions, Inc. and America Online was settled today.  Each of the 
 parties agreed to mutual releases without monetary damages.  AOL gave 
 Cyber Promotions permission to continue to send its commercial email into 
 AOL's system.   Cyber can send its email from up to five different domain 
 names, including tosguard.com, which protects AOL members from having 
 their accounts terminated for advertising with Cyber Promotions.  AOL 
 also agreed to periodically announce to its members that they can opt-in 
 to the receipt of commercial email from companies like Cyber Promotions 
 by going to keyword: PreferredMail and checking it off. 
  
  Cyber Promotions' president, Sanford Wallace, stated "This 
 settlement is a victory for everyone involved.  Cyber will benefit from 
 the fact that AOL is now permanently allowing Cyber Promotions to send 
 commercial email into its system.  This will also benefit AOL members 
 because AOL's preferred mail tool will now give the recipient a choice 
 to either receive or block commercial email." 
  
 -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 ATTENTION AOL MEMBERS: 
  
 If you wish to continue receiving Cyber Promotions' emailings, 
 you must follow the "preferred mail" directions below. 
 Cyber will only send email to AOL members who disable 
 "preferred mail" as of this Friday, Feb 7, 1997. 
  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
CONSENT ORDER

As part of a resolution of this litigation, the parties agree to the entry 
of this Order:

It is on this 4th day of Feb. 1997, ORDERED that defendants, Cyber 
Promotions, Inc. ("Cyber") and Sanford A. Wallace, and their officers, 
agents, servants, employees and any persons in active concert or 
participation with them (collectively, "enjoinees"), are enjoined 
effective February 7, 1997, as follows:

1. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, all unsolicited 
e-mail sent by enjoinees to AOL or any of its members must be sent from 
one of five domain names ("cyberpromo.com, answerme.com, savetrees.com, 
pleaseread.com, or tosguard.com") registered with InterNIC and the header 
containing the return address of such email must bear the same one of the 
five domain names.  In other words, enjoinees are prohibited from 
circumventing or attempting to circumvent the filtering effects of the 
"PreferredMail" tool.

2. Cyber shall configure the computers and software they use to enable 
any AOL subscriber to remove himself or herself promptly and permanently 
from Cyber's mailing list by use of the e-mail reply command.

LEGAL QUESTION: IS IT OK TO SPAM THE SPAMMERS?

From: "Greg Bulmash" <gbhp@worldnet.att.net> 
Subject: Here's a question for the happy hackers...

If some stupid-ass web site e-mail spammed you, could you set up a 
script to go to one of their publicly accessible pages and constantly 
re-load selected graphics without caching them, allowing it to eat 
their bandwidth as fast as your modem and their server could handle for 
as long as you were willing to tie up your system?

Also, is there a way to eat their bandwidth faster than your modem 
can download it, i.e. sending requests as fast as you can send them 
with packet spoofing so the graphics are being sent as fast as 
their server and line can handle right into a bitbucket?

I know that this isn't necessarily a good thing because it could be 
used against any web site you wanted to bankrupt out of existence, so 
please don't post the answer on how to do it.  Just post whether it's 
possible and whether it's legal.

This proliferation of e-mail spam has just ticked me off too much and 
it would be really nice to sort of say "You want to waste bandwidth? 
Okay, then let's waste some bandwidth, s*****!" and zing these jerks 
where it really hurts... in the wallet.

PRO-SPAM ISP DISCOVERED

From: "Greg Bulmash" <gbhp@worldnet.att.net> 
Subject: Spam Encouragement?

For the HH List:

Got spammed, and while checking out the spammer's ISP, I found this 
public policy.

------------------------------ 
Business e-mail

Business e-mail, a.k.a. "spamming" is defined in many way by many 
people. We choose not to enter a debate on the definition of "spam'.

We allow the sending of business e-mail to legally promote legal 
activities.

Business e-mail sites downstream of Sallynet.com (either its direct 
customers or customer's customers, ad infinitum) must adhere to these 
guidelines noted below. The intent is not to prevent any specific 
activity per se, but to require business e-mail senders to retain 
responsibility for their actions:

Business e-mailers on our system must have a From: or Reply-to: address 
that reaches a valid address of the sender. The sender must offer to 
remove the recipient from the business e-mailers list in the message. A 
business e-mail site may not intentionally deceive or misrepresent 
themselves in order to subvert detection or avoid this policy. Business 
e-mail site must make reasonable efforts to check all mailing list for 
duplicates.

Sallynet.com will follow the procedure below for dealing with 
complaints about a specific site.

Complaints about specific sites will be reviewed for illegal content.

Note: When submitting complaints, remember that the sending of e-mail, 
whether deemed solicited or unsolicited is not illegal.

We will not review complaints containing profanity. Threats of a 
fiscal or technical nature will be forwarded immediately to the proper 
state and federal authorities.

-------------------------

I know only "legal" hacking is encouraged, but what can be done about 
****-offs like this?  You can find the ISP's site at www.sallynet.com.

UGLY INTERNET HOAX REVEALED

From: "Greg Bulmash" <gbhp@worldnet.att.net> 
Date: Wed, 5 Feb 1997 23:49:47 -0800 
Subject: Interesting Hoax?

Got this in the mail tonight.  The gbhp@ix.netcom.com account was 
cancelled a while back and just autoforwards.  As well, I doubt after 
the Mitnick incident, Netcom would be dumb enough to keep sensitive 
info on a networked computer that could be hacked from outside.

Looks like a mail spoof where some a**** in Germany is trying to 
cause a panic.  Thought I'd send it your way to show to the HH people 
to see what they think. Full headers are attached.

Moderator: This is definitely a hoax. The best tip-off is the "disconnect 
your phone" line. Another tip-off is that few people keep their credit card 
numbers on their hard disks. Get real, guys. But what is really bad about 
this hoax is that incites irrational fear of hackers.

Maybe it's nothing, maybe it's something, but if my guess is at all 
correct, the jig is up.  Run it by your security experts.  But if any 
police are going to be called, I think the ones in his city will be the 
first.

DC-STUFF HACKER LIST FLAME WAR RAGES

Moderator: our special email bomber flame war issue, in which I let 
*everyone* flame to the max, has started a major flame war on the topic on 
the dc-stuff email list. Since that moderated list doesn't allow me to post, 
it is of course the perfect forum for those who don't want argument with 
their positions that making email bombing programs available at the click of 
a mouse is somehow freedom of speech.  My response is that these programs 
are weapons and no more an expression of freedom of speech than is handing 
out loaded guns on a school playground.

If you would like to get involved in a moderated hacker list in which so 
many can make the Orwellain argument that it is freedom of speech to stifle 
freedom of speech by the handing out of email bombing programs, you may 
subscribe by emailing majordomo@dis.org with message "subscribe dc-stuff." 
List moderator is Pete Shipley <shipley@dis.org.>, an extremely talented 
hacker and a security consultant to Wells Fargo. You may be able to get in 
some opinions contrary to his at first because his procedure is to wait to 
see if he doesn't like your ideas, in which case he first emails you 
privately with an insulting message. Then, if you don't toe the line, he 
imposes a blanket ban on any further posts from you.
