*** Hacker Wargame Update
===================================================================

The Hacker Wargame is about to get better. We will soon be able to display
(on http://www.happyhacker.org) exciting logs of both legal game break-in
attempts and illegal assaults against the ISP donating the T1 to our game.

This improvement is thanks to two companies who have provided us with
software for observing hacker attacks (sniffers): AG Group, which is
providing us with EtherPeek 3.5 for Macintosh Power PC (also available on
Windows NT and 95); and En Garde Systems, Inc., which is providing
IP-Watcher for Unix and T-Sight for Windows NT. These packages are capable
of identifying the true source of a spoofed IP address, and allow us to
watch what an attacker is doing keystroke by keystroke.

We also have donations of a 66 Mhz Mac and a top of the line Mac G3, which
is capable of operations in the ballpark of a RISC box! We will be using
the Macs for sniffing, logging and perhaps for Web servers.

Macs are supposed to be impossible to hack any way other than by sniffing a
clear text password. We are really excited to have them in the game.

We will get up a newbie box that is easy to break into as soon as we have
set up to quickly restore the operating system from CD-ROM every time the
31337 haxors delete the operating system. For some reason they are
TERRIFIED that newbies might be able to learn something from this game.

Please understand that the Hacker Wargame relies 100% on donated hardware,
software and volunteer labor. So please be patient with us.

I have been a reader of your happy hacker works for a few months now. I
am the System Administrator of a Linux server for a small school for
gifted students in Mobile, AL. I have just tracked down and crushed a
black hat who was hacking my box.

I would like to take some time from the natural high that follows such an
action (;-&gt) to thank you for what you have done. I am a student here
myself, do not (yet) have a degree in computer science, and am still
learning Linux and other forms of networking. Without your website, I
would have been completely lost as to how to kill this hacker.

So... thanks a lot! You have helped me (and a lot of other young
SysAdmins, I suspect) greatly. Keep up the good work!

I have noticed on the Happy Hacker page about the Hacker War Games..I am
wondering do I need to register to join in?? or do I just go straight
and try and get root access to ??
and once I do get root access what do I do? who do I inform etc..
I would like to join in on this and am eager to try it.

[You don't need to register. If you are working from a shell account at an
ISP instead of form your home Linux, OpenBSD etc. box, you may want to
advise your ISP that you are studying computer security just in case someone
notices what you are doing.

Once you get root, trust me, we will notice. If you want the whole world to
notice, put your boasts up on the Web page of the Wargame computer you broke
into. -- Carolyn Meinel]

Subject: More ZDNet Talk Back on Hacker Wargame

 

Just read Moe Dify's remarks. Are you really not liked by 98.9% of the
hacker community? How did they get that number, mail in survey, phone
canvassing, interviewing people in malls?

Gee... 98.9% Wish I had a good hard definitive number by which to
identify my enemies (if I had any, that is - 100% of everybody likes
me).

*** Windows NT Hacking
===================================================================

From: cutelilbabyboy@hotmail.com

You wanted to know how to hack WindowsNT, well here goes!

1) Disconnect from the server. This sounds harder than it actually is! 
Simply remove the network cable from the 'victim' terminal (the one 
which looks like a phone cable).

2) Reset your computer.

3) After loading windows, the computer automatically tries to boot into 
the network, but can't find the server MUHAHAHA!. It will display the 
error message 'No server found to validate password. You may not be able 
to gain access to some network resources'.

4) Accept the error and continue. The computer figures that bad things 
have happened and gives you the administrator password box. DO NOT press 
'enter' at any stage here until I say so! Use the mouse to change boxes! 
Change the username 'propagate' (system default) to Baby-boy (or any 
kewl hacker name).

5) Delete the demonstration password and replace it with any password of 
your choice. Make it easy! you have to remember it!

6) Change the network name from 'RMNETNT' or 'BORINGNET' or whatever 
your networks calling itself, to 'NAFFNET' or any name that takes your 
fancy.

7) Press enter. This will return you to the normal logon screen. (but 
you will now notice, this is a logon screen to 'NAFFNET', not your usual 
network!

8) Enter the username and password that you used before.

9) Again, the error message 'No server was found to validate your 
password'. Hit 'enter'.

10) Bingo! the computer puts you into normal windows on that terminal.

11) Replace the network cable, and you're ready to hack using Telnet, 
or any other program stored on that terminal.

[Update to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 will invalidate this bug. But you
can still evade security with the NT rescue disk. -- Trave Harmon of Harmon

>From anonymous:

I'm fairly new to this as far as hacking goes anyway but a
friend told me about this really easy hack with win 95 NT 4.0 or win 98.
I don't know if you know about this or not, but here goes.
as far as I can tell you have to have file and printer sharing enabled or
rather the victim does at any rate for this to work. you get an IP address
go to the start menu go to find then computer input the IP address like this
\\000.000.000.000 then click on find now.
this will find regular users ISP's whatever this will show you the contents
of the shared drives files whatever. no log in no nothing as far as it's
concerned you are on the LAN!!!!
I got into me ISP's secondary domain server without a password or even a
login. As far as I can see unless you password protect your shared hard
drive you are open to this. If you know how to get around it or close this
hole let me know I'll pass it on to my ISP.
-------------------------------------------

From: ahlternate@hotmail.com

I read the file begin.html and found it most instructive. I must say, 
however, that the method described for compromising CMOS passwords is 
somewhat drastic. So, here is a trick witch works on at least Win3.1 and 
definitely DOS. I would not be surprised if it worked on Win95. 
Unfortunately Win NT blocks it, well, as far as I can tell anyhow.

The principle is that you by writing to the CMOS-memory by ports 70h/71h 
corrupt the CMOS checksum. On many CMOS's this will cause the password 
to either be inactive, deleted or reverted to a standard easily guessed 
one e. g. AMI.

There is one easy and one hard way to do this.
Either you write the program in debug.exe e. g.

C:\debug.exe
-a
0C03:0100 mov al,10
0C03:0102 out 70,al
0C03:0104 mov ah,al
0C03:0106 in al,71
0C03:0108 not al
0C03:010A xchg al,ah
0C03:010C out 70,al
0C03:010E mov al,ah
0C03:0110 out 71,al
0C03:0112 int 20
0C03:0114
-r

Now, I am not sure that lines 010a to 010e are really necessary, but, 
they are there anyway. This little program inverts the value (at 
position 10h) which tells the system what sort of floppy-drive to 
expect, fairly harmless. There are, of course, addresses which controls 
the password itself and how it will be used. These however are rather 
manufacturer-dependent so this, I think, is a more general method. (If 
you as you proposed, want to reset the CMOS you should (if you can) do 
it 'in silica' anyway, and not 'in vivo'.)

The hard way of doing this is, of course, to write this in notepad, 
using <ALT+numeric-keypad>and save it in a .COM file. I have not tried 
that myself but if anyone wants to bother the following

B0 10 E6 70 88 C4 E4 71 F6 D0 86 C4 E6 70 88 E0 E6 71 CD 20

is the hex values.

 

If this was new to you, especially if you plan to include it in any of 
your articles, I would be glad you would send me a comment.

*** Yahoo Password Problem
==================================================================

From: Craig Harvey

I downloaded that crappy Yahoo news ticker and I believe it is a security
threat to people who use this and/or Yahoo mail, Chat. The news ticker
keeps the persons password in the registry in plain text, no encryption or
anything.

*** Free Computer Manuals
=================================================================
From: DarkMaven

You probably already know about this, but at 
Personal Bookshelf you can get
free computer books. (It's kind of like a library. You check out a book
for 90 days) The have books like UNIX Unleashed, Learn TCP/IP in 14 days,
Linux, and lots of books on programming and for those beginners. It might
be a good place you can point beginners or something.

*** Fun with Finger
==================================================================
From: Magnus Kristiansen

TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FINGER

Some fingerd installations support redirections to another host.

Ex:
$finger @system.two.com@system.one.com

finger will in the example go through system.one.com and on to
system.two.com. As far as system.two.com knows it is system.one.com who is
fingering. So this method can be used for hiding, but also for a very dirty
denial of service attack. Look at this:

$ finger @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@host.we.attack

All those @ signs will get finger to finger host.we.attack again and again
and again... The effect on host.we.attack is powerful and the result is high
bandwidth, short free memory and a hard disk with less free space, due to
all child processes.

The solution is to install a fingerd which don't support redirections, for
example GNU finger. You could also turn the finger service off.

*** Anonymous Email

>From mAChIneheaD2

Carolyn,
I have been reading your web site happy hacker and here's some tip's 
1.a while back I made a bulk email program with vb4
I bought a Mabry ocx for mail, after trying out my bulk mailer I found that
you can use it as a anonymous mail program or so it seems I have only sent
myself mail I'll send you one with this letters text for a final check
2. while messing with the "upload file" option on Netscape I did a nono on
my ISP step1. make a dir (called say upload)on your server, I used my ftp
account 
step2. do a "chmod 777 upload" at this point you still own the dir called
"upload" 
step3. go to your upload dir with Netscape and dragany file into the
Netscape window and the file will go to that dir(upload),now this is what
happens, ftp will own the dir making a hole that anybody can upload to
anonymously . this worked on redhat 4.5

for your information and for those who are looking around for 
windows/dos executables of "land", "bonk" and "newtear" DoS exploits, 
there is a website (I think it is on geocities) that has these files 
available for downloading....!!! (wow! what's the URL????????)

there is only one minor (errr...major actually!) setback. these files
are not what it claims to be and executing them wipes out boot and ini files
and renders your windows o/s helpless. gives a person food for thought !

*** Linux Answers
=================================================================
From: Aasmund Eikli
Organization: Setec Astronomy

I know these questions was asked quite some issues ago, but I'll 
answer some of them anyway:

Berd I. Skjfveland asked about Linux installing some digests ago.

The first question was about having Win95 and Linux on the same 
machine:

This will work just fine. Especially if you have Win95 already 
running on your machine it will be even easier. All you have to do is 
to install LILO (Linux Loader, it's in both RedHat and Slackware) in 
the MBR (Master Boot Record of your HD), and then configure LILO to 
have two OS's. The first one is already installed and is Linux, then 
you can configure it to run an MS-DOS partition, and on that 
partition WIn95 resides already. It is quite easy explained in the 
Setup process of LILO. Just follow instructions. However, on RedHat 
(at least 4.0), LILO does not come with an external setup program 
within the normal Install program for the system. You have to 
configure the LILO.conf file for yourself if you want to have Win95 
in your boot as well. In Slackware this is no problem, the setup 
program does the job for you.

The second question was about buying an extra HD to have Linux on. 
This is just great and as far as I am concerned a requirement. You 
can of course have two partitions on a HD, but that would eat up much 
space which you could use for Win95. So I'd recommend to buy another 
HD and install it on there. All you really have to do is to install 
the HD, the BIOS finds it, and you run the Linux bootup disks. Then 
run Linux' FDISK program and select HD2 (the partition information 
would probably be hdb, and not hda cause its your second HD). Just 
partition the HD and set the system to Linux Native, and you're all 
set. As long as you select the SECOND HD your stuff on HD1 is left 
unchanged.

As for what Linux system is easiest to use, I would recommend RedHat 
for beginners, then move on to Slackware. I use Slackware or FreeBSD.

When you are experienced in DOS, but only a file-manager like Norton 
Commander, Linux might seem like a nightmare to start with. But if 
you choose to install a program called MIDNIGHT COMMANDER, you're 
doing a smart thing. This program is much like Norton Commander but 
its for Linux. Make sure to install this program.

When you have a network card, and 
a modem installed on a Linux system, the TCP/IP protocol can 
misunderstand this and tell you that you cant use the modem cause the 
Network card is already using those programs. What you have to do (in 
any case what I always do), is to recompile the kernel and choose to 
have the network card as a MODULE. It always works for me. It 
requires some more configuring, but nothing much.

A Question from Abuser caught my attention.
It is possible to install Linux with an ONTRACK TSR. You just have to 
make sure that LILO does NOT install on the MBR. And I'm not sure if 
even this is necessary, cause ONTRACK uses the first cylinders of 
the boot sector, and I'm quite sure it doesn't touch the MBR at all. 
Either way, you cant screw up the ONTACK manager. After installing 
LILO, just install the MSDOS partition in it, and you are all set.

That's all for now.

>Important note: in order to use Secure Shell, your Internet access provider

>Then hit enter. If you don't click "RSA," your password will be sniffable
>and gremlins may run rampant in your shell account!

>From the man page:

If other authentication methods fail, ssh prompts the user
for a password. The password is sent to the remote host
for checking; however, since all communications are
encrypted, the password cannot be seen by someone
listening on the network.

[Carolyn: There must be a way to misconfigure Secure Shell, then, because I
have a problem with clear text passwords, per the sniffer test! It's scary
when a security program is easy to run so it isn't secure.]

>1) Give the command "rm .bash_history" for bash shell (or if in Bourne
>shell, "rm .history")
>
>2) Give the command "ln -s /dev/null ~/.bash_history" (or "ln /dev/null
>.history" for Bourne).

for bash try this in your .bashrc/.bash_profile:

export HISTFILESIZE=0
export HISTFILE=

this will set the history file size to 0 lines, and unset the HISTFILE
environment variable, each on their own should do the job, and be less
conspicuous than a synlink to /dev/null
