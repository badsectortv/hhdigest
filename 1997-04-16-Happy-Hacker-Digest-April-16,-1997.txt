*** GTmHH Strikes 
=============================================================================

From: [anonymous]

 You may be interested to know that my school has shut down its 
Internet connection indefinitely.  The cause?  No, we weren't infected 
by some sUpEr 31337 haxor's virus.  In fact it was the administrators, 
themselves, that shut it down!  They were a bit concerned that the 
most use it was getting was for students who were eager to print out 
all of the GtMHH.  I, for one, am relieved in a way: at _least_ they 
got their information from an ethically responsible source... I've had 
some very disturbing conversations that have me fearing for our 
future. Now if the administrators had only read them, as well, this 
may have never happened!

[Matt: Ignorance isn't always bliss.]

It's just a shame that RFCs can be *so* bloody boring and complicated 
over-the-top. This of course depends on the RFC in question, but 
sometimes you just want a list of the commands.

Minicom is a terminal program, right? It should connect to all modems 
which answer.

Isn't dip for dialing in? If you're referring to Minicom as the tool 
for for connecting and setting up a PPP connection, it seems like 
overkill.

YO! Happy Hackers ;-) 
1. Is C++ the same as Borland Turbo C++? Is Turbo C++ a good 
programming language for hacking?

[Matt: Borland Turbo C++ is just a compiler (with some extra stuff) 
for standard C++. There are other compilers, though, like gcc, Watcom, 
etc.]

2.  I can telnet to a server running unix from my WIN95 Box and then I 
can run  unix commands on it.  Is this a shell account?

[Matt: Yep.]

Which address should we email for posts (hacker@... or matt@...)? 
Carolyn, are you quitting this list?  PLEASE DON'T QUIT.  What 
happened to HHdigest Apr. 14, 1997, I didn't get it or was there any?

[Matt: Don't worry, Carolyn is still very much involved with the Happy 
Hacker Digest. I'm just helping her; she's very busy. Send your posts 
to matt@cs.utexas.edu (and try to stick "HH" in the subject header). 
There wasn't a HH Digest for Apr. 14; It's not strictly a daily thing; 
it gets sent out whenever we have enough good posts and have time to 
format it and everything.]

A segmentation fault happens when a program makes a big mistake. 
In general, there are only three reasons for this to happen 
1) Poor programing - the program does somthing very invalid. 
2) Poor programing - the program doesn't check its arguments, and you 
   gave it bogus input. 
3) Extreme low memory - do a 'free', and look at the results 
4) I said there were only three!

>I'm writing you because of finger program.

You mean the finger daemon.

(Carolyn: let's get off this habit of insisting other people use one's 
favorite subset. Finger is a class of programs, some of which run in a 
way that is called a "daemon." [My half dozen Win 95 finger programs 
aren't daemons.] But every daemon is a program of some sort, so it is 
correct to call even those finger programs that run as daemons 
"programs." So program is a correct designation.)

I agree, I like having the finger port open, if only for my own use, 
even. However, your finger daemon can be vulnerable, I turned mine off 
after hearing of a bug which allowed people to run any command on my 
computer through the daemon, even formatting my harddrive if they 
wished. Don't know if your deamon is secure, but if it isn't (is 
anything?), then you might want to turn it off or get another one.

It's checked for things like file privileges and ownership and 
checking whether you have access to certain binaries and the such.

*** More Denial Of Service (DOS)

While DOS for the sake of DOS is lame, it can have some powerful 
applications.  For instance, every ip spoofing technique I've seen 
RELIES on a DOS attack! Besides, often a DOS attack does not crash the 
computer, only denies it of service.  In the case of ip spoofing, the 
DOS is generally only necessary for a short time, therefore its not 
really destructive or irresponsible.

I'm looking for some other mailing lists to subscribe to. It's 
hard to find them on the internet, and when I do, the e-mail address

*** Cracking DES 
=============================================================================

From: "Mishari \"CykiX\" Muqbil" <mishari@thepentagon.com>

Hello all. I just wanted all you people with cpu's to know that 
there're massive projects going on to crack the "Legal" encryption 
scheme called 56-bit DES. I have found this really cool place at 
solnet http://www.des.sollentuna.se/ which is co-ordinating one of the 
projects. I prefer this one because it is for the whole 'net (the sad 
folks who host it in the US cannot get participants from outside 
because of the export law). So all of you who read this, go there, 
grab your client and run it (WITH PERMISSION) on as many pc's, 
workstations and servers as you possibly can. Another thing about this 
is that at default setting, it takes up IDLE cpu cycles ONLY! So it 
doesn't bother with your browser rendering the images on those porno 
sites ;-)But, you can use the -n 1 option (like I do) to speed things 
up.

What are yaz waiting 4? Go get those CRACKERS!

Platform support for Win95/NT, Alpha(linux), Alpha(OSF/1), MIPS(IRIX), 
Linux(intel), NextStep(m68k), Solaris(sparc), SunOS(Sparc), ULTRIX

If your platform isn't supported, you can give them a guest account on 
your machine, and they'll compile one just 4 u! After it's all done, 
you can put your grandchildren on your lap and say "I helped them 
break the 56-bit DES key" ;-)

*** Stopping Spam 
==============================================================================

From: GR8GUY <cyoung@northernnet.com>

don't know if you know about this but i found it very interesting...

Spam Ban 
spamming-the practice of sending unsolicited e-mail advertising, 
usually in bulk-would become a misdemeanor under a bill being 
considered by the state of Nevada. If passed, the bil would make a 
Nevada the first state to outlaw spamming. Critics say that the bill 
would hurt small businesses, wich can't afford more expensive 
advertising media. The Nevada senate's judiciary committee is 
considering the proposed revisions of the bill and at press 
time had not set a timetable for a vote. California and virginia are 
considering similar e-mail advertising bans.

Is about "Spam Hater*. I checked the site 
www.compulink.co.uk/net-services, but I had only a "the URL you 
request is not on this server" message. After wandering around, I 
found the correct address which is the following: 
www.compulink.co.uk/pub/net-services. Another problem: I found TWO 
"Spam Hater" files, named spam.exe and spam1.exe. Which one is to 
download? Perhaps both?

*** Using mIRC To Spoof Email 
========================================================================

From: pc2000 <pc2000@hooked.net>

Hello all Happy Hackers:

 I see the latest craze is to spoof email. Well there is another way 
to do it via irc. I can send spoofed email from a dcc chat session. It 
is pretty easy. I use mirc so I havent tested it with anything else. 
Here is how I do it: 
 

First paste this into alias section: 
 

/long /echo 6 $longip( $$1 )

/port { 
  raw -q privmsg $me : 
  DCC CHAT CHAT $$1 $$2 $+ 
} 
  
 

Next step is to convert the domain to ip then to long ip: 
say we wanna send email through lava.net's deamon you do this (all 
from mirc)

/dns lava.net 
 

*** Looking up lava.net

-

*** Resolved lava.net to 199.222.42.2 
 

Now we must convert the IP to long IP 
 

/long 199.222.42.2

3353225730  = long ip 
 

Then you type: 
 

/mail 3353225730 25 
 

You will get a dcc chat request from yourself. Accept it and you 
will see

220 malasada.lava.net Smail3.1.28.1 #9 ready at Tue, 15 Apr 97 
14:08 WET

You can type HELP and get the help menu put to quickly show you how to 
do it 
  
first type:

HELO someone@somewhere.com

You will see the response:

250 malasada.lava.net Hello someone@somewhere 
 

Next input who it is from:

MAIL FROM: bgates@microsnot.com

Then say from who it goes to:

RCPT TO: santa@north.pole.org

Now type: DATA and you will see:

354 Enter mail, end with "." on a line by itself

Now type whatever body message you want and when you finish the email

put a "." by itself w/o " " and you will see:

250 Mail accepted

Then type: QUIT to exit the system and close the dcc chat 
session.

You can also use this to port surf places to and find new ports.

Just use this syntax:

/mail <<long ip> <<port>

Remember you have to convert a regular ip to long ip and that is 
it. Have fun. BTW I have found many ports surfing like this. And I 
didnt have to use a shell account. (I get lazy sometimes..hahahah =) )

*** Restricting talk/write using mesg 
================================================================================

From: ".o0ORSNAKEO0o." <rsnake@ecst.csuchico.edu>

 There is another mesg setting.  It is mesg g.  Mesg g allows 
for talk requests and for writes (assuming the sender has mesg g or 
mesg y) but not for banners cats or echos that are re-directed to your 
terminal. (I am not quite sure where wall comes in because I don't 
want to piss off everyone here at Chico...).  Mesg g is considered to 
be the safest of the three, when combined with .talkdeny and 
.talkallow, however there are still programs to mess with terminal 
settings that work through talk-requests.  IE: 
http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~rsnake/flash.zip 
Personally I always have mesg n, and tell people to send me e-mail if 
they want to talk to me (using newmail -i 10 to notify).  You can send 
a talk request as mesg n but cannot recieve one, so you can send a 
talk request as mesg n, and then have the recipient turn their mesgs 
to n before responding to the request, to have secure chatting.  Just 
some thoughts.

====================================================================== 
*** Uncrackable Passwords (or pretty close..) 
======================================================================

From: "Alan C. Ramsbottom" <acr@ALS.CO.UK>

This is based on insights gained by writing a brute-force "cracker" 
attacking the SAM hashes. In the *worst case* with typical hardware, 
I currently believe that it will take a few hundred years to 
brute-force a password that obeys all the following rules:

1) It contains upper and lower case alphas i.e. characters 
   from 'A'..'Z' or 'a'..'z'.

   (Mixing the case does not help much in this attack but it 
    may hinder other approaches)

2) It contains a numeric i.e. '0'..'9'.

3) It contains a punctuation symbol i.e. '!','&','>' etc. 
   Don't just use these three, there are many more to chose 
   from.

4) It contains a character entered with an ALT sequence selected 
   from the following list *only*. Type ALT then one of the four 
   digit numbers below to enter these characters in your password.

   0131    0199    0224    0231    0237    0244    0252 
   0135    0201    0225    0232    0238    0246    0255 
   0149    0209    0226    0233    0239    0247 
   0196    0214    0228    0234    0241    0249 
   0197    0220    0229    0235    0242    0250 
   0198    0223    0230    0236    0243    0251

5) It is exactly 7 *or* exactly 14 characters long. It will give you 
   extra protection against random luck if you use 14 characters but 
   each half (7 characters) must conform to the above rules *and* 
   contain some different characters.

Note the stress on "worst case", the program might get your password 
with its first lucky guess. Oh, and there are no guarantees for any 
of this :-(

PS: I will send an extremely pretty table showing the "password 
entry process Windows Character Set (Unicode above 0x007F) to ASCII 
translations" to anyone who can convince me that they know why it 
is relevant and asks nicely :-)

PPS: I'm part way trying to document the aforementioned "logic" 
behind the brute-force aspect of the SAM attack issue and will post 
it ASAP. Are there any potential contributers/"pre-publication" 
reviewers out there?

 Uhm, I personally always use Q-modem for DOS.  It is really 
nice. It has the fastest re-dialer I have seen, and is only mildly 
clunky when you aren't used to it.  I don't know where to pick it up, 
since I just got a copy from a friend.  There is a newer version for 
Windows, but I haven't used it so I can't recommend it.  Hasta!

*** Hacking Rental Cars 
=============================================================================

From: "E-mail Anonymous" <anonymouszzzz@hotmail.com> 
 

So the other day I went on vacation with my family and we rented a car 
from Hertz, and the car had one of those Global Tracking Computers 
built in.  Well this got me thinking: I bet this thing is hackable!! I 
played around with it a bit but everytime I started to mess with the 
wires my mom got p*****d.  On the back of the console ( the part that 
is in the front of the car) there is a small serial port plug thing 
with no label or anything but It can be easily removed...and plugged 
into something else...say a laptop..But I don't have much experience 
with this kind of stuff and I was wondering if anyone out there has 
ever tried to hack one of these, or if it is even possible?? I think 
we're renting a car again in a month or so and next time i want to be 
prepared..if anyone has any info on hacking one of  these please post 
it to this list or e-mail it to me at anonymouszzzz@hotmail.com,

Well if the admin of the nt box is stupid then it is so easy its not 
funny log into the guest account and look at the registry to see if he 
has set up an auto logon if so you get his password i think your fried 
just pulled the wool over your eyes with some easy tricks and made it 
look good ;) if you configure nt properly it is much harder to get 
access to...ie rename admin/guest accounts ... disable guest account 
... restrict registry access...NEVER use auto logon etc etc to give 
you an idea.

*** General Advice 
==========================================================================

From: Warpy <warpy@null.net>

This email is basically a general note to all of you "happy hackers" 
on why you get flamed and how to avoid it. There might also be some 
replies about questions from previous hh's that i couldn't be bothered 
writing about.

Please note: Carolyn and readers this is NOT a flame, though it may 
seem like it. This is just me getting something off my chest which has 
been bothering me for a while.

Why does this list and those who subscribe to it get flamed so much? 
This is a pretty easy question to answer actually. I have been "with" 
hh since close to the beginning and I have seen the actual content 
quality decrease in that time due to ppl asking blatantly DUMB 
questions. To begin with it was good, people asking newbiesh 
questions, but at least they were regarding Unix, and not that pseudo 
32-bit wannabe OS known as Win95. The GTmHH's (guides to mostly 
harmless hacking) were good too. I think the point were they started 
going under was right after the mapping the internet guide, when 
*puke* Win95 began the hot topic.

People write in and ask questions on modifying pretty pictures on 
their bloody IE 3.0 browsers. I mean, this digest is SUPPOSED to be 
about hacking, and whereas hacking might have been getting a printer 
to bump and vibrate across the floor in wierd patterns using some 
interesting code back when Carolyn was younger.. the definition has 
since changed. I realise that, a lot of the readers of hh realise 
that, and the majority of those who read dc-stuff realise that, but 
Carolyn appears not to.

But then again perhaps she does. Perhaps she realises that if she had 
continued on with her guides in the way she was doing so her 
readership would/could get their newbie-selves into trouble, and by 
restricting what is published she could possibly hope to avoid that. 
But while she can restrict what she publishes here, she cannot 
restrict what is out there on the Net. If someone has got enough 
incentive to learn, then they will find what they are looking for.

Yet ANOTHER reason why you guys get flamed so much is that you ask so 
many STUPID questions. Or rather, the questions themselves are not 
stupid, but did you think to spend that 10-20-30 minutes longer to 
take the time to look the answer up on the Net yourself? I mean this 
digest gets innundated with the same questions over and over again. 
Don't you think that somewhere out there, someone has taken the time 
to sit down and write put the answer to your very question. The answer 
is yes. You need help installing linux, goto one of the hundreds of 
linux sites and read the HOWTO's. Need help finding Win95 software for 
*cough* hacking? Look at www.tucows.com, one of the largest archives 
of GOOD Win95 software, all of which is either freeware or shareware. 
Looking for general info on hacking, try entering "hack" at YAHOO or 
Altavista. I mean, for crying out loud ppl, the information is out 
there at your fingertips, why not spend those terrible extra minutes 
to look for it yourself instead of posting to hh-digest. If you've 
legitimately got a problem which you have looked for the answer 
yourself, and were unable to find, then sure post. But if your post is 
like "how do i find the amount of disk space left on my partition in 
linux" AYE CARUMBA. Five minutes if not less in #linux or #linuxhelp 
will get you the answer. The reason why you get flamed so much is 
because the answer is out there and you're all to lazy to find it. 
Btw, the answer to the dudes question is by typing "df" at the command 
prompt.

Well I think i've managed to encapsulate both why the hh-digest and 
the people who post to it get flamed so much, and how it can be 
avoided. Use COMMON SENSE. As a very funny but too true quote said: 
"Invent something idiot-proof, and they will invent a better idiot".

Now for some responses to questions..

*To anonymous - IP spoofing is difficult enough to understand for most 
Unix heads, how do you think a Windows programmer will be able to 
comprehend it? In other words, no there is NO (as far as i know) Win95 
application for ip spoofing.

(Carolyn: I got a Win 95 IP spoofer:):)

*To Psst - The reason you should close the finger port (79) is mainly 
because it gives away too much information to any casual remote user. 
Not only that but on older versions of finger daemon you could crash a 
system by finger @@@@@@@@@@@@host.com

*To Robert Finger - In regards to your question about Corewars and 
winners publishing how they managed it. NO! This is one of my biggest 
worries about it. That corporate security will turn it into some 
"let's learn what the hackers are using now". As for regular hackers 
watching the competition, i think a descritption like - used a buffer 
overflow, incorrect permissions, or old sendmail should be more than 
enough information.

(Carolyn: Warpy, Warpy, this list is about *legal* hacking. We want to 
make it easier, not harder, for people to make their systems secure.)

*To EVERYONE asking about local hackers - No sensible hacker is going 
to announce "I'm here!" to the world. If you want to look for hackers 
in your local area why not try looking at the 2600 Meeting list at:

That's about all I have to say today... :)

(Carolyn: Warpy, all us people who enjoy legal hacking are happy to 
identify ourselves and help others to learn. True, recently it has 
become a big deal among certain elements of the hacker world to 
believe that if something is legal, it isn't real hacking. I say 
"pooh" to them.)
