HOW TO CATCH EMAIL BOMBERS (OR KEEP FROM GETTING CAUGHT)

Moderator: I had to think about whether I would post this one a bit. It 
offers information that makes it easier for email bombers to get away with 
their attacks. But on the other hand, it will show all the systems 
administrators and security experts on this list why they absolutely should 
run Identd. And it shows us all how to catch the run of the mill email 
bomber. Heh, heh.

From: bbuster@succeed.net (Bronc Buster!!!) 
Subject: Checking Anonymous Servers

This is a simple way, for all you people that are not sure how, or what 
Identd is, to see if a server is running it. Most people have no idea what 
Identd is, or does, but it's very important thing to know when you are 
trying to do something and not get caught (i.e. Mail Bombing). I won't go 
into the ins and outs of Identd here; but what it does (for e-mail), in 
laymans terms, is once you connect and try to send an e-mail, it wants to 
know who you are, so it asks your systems Identd and they pass information 
to each other and when they are done, the other system knows all about you 
(well enough so you can get pinned) and pastes all this information onto the 
Header file that is a part of the e-mail message. Let me show you a part of 
one from some lamer who bombed me a few days ago:

This was from <You@S***.net> and sent to me and LordSumner. As you can see 
he used another server to try and cover his/her/it's tracks, but it was 
running Identd so he/she/it was easily tracked back. Let's tear this apart!

--------------Begin Header--------------------------

to **his/her/it's Identd. The five "*" you see are his/her/it's e-mail that 
I **took out for this

-------------End Header-----------------------

So you ask, how do I know if a server is running Identd? You say you don't 
know enough to send yourself an e-mail and then look at the header in your 
shell, or maybe you don't have the resources. Well never fear. After doing 
some testing over the last few weeks I found that ANY up to date mIRC client 
will tell you. 
How? Ok:

1. Open your mIRC client like you would to get on an IRC server, but don't 
connect.

2. Open an e-mail program (of your choice, but remember normal ones will do 
a HELO and give you away) and send an e-mail to yourself.

3. Go back to the mIRC client and look on the Status window. If you see the 
same thing you saw when you opened it up the first time, your safe. If you 
see ANYTHING else, like "Idnetd Request from 123.123.123.123" move on to the 
next  server because it is running the Identd and you'll get busted!

If you want to know more about the ins and outs of Sendmail, SMTP and other 
mail holes, do a NetSearch for "sendmail or "SMTP", or go get a good book on 
Unix. No site or book is without something on Sendmail as it has been, and 
still is, one of the biggest security holes in the Unix operating system. 
Good Luck and Happy Hacking!

I also find picking improper nouns with the proper flair and properising 
them works well, yielding handles that don't sound like you stole the name 
from somebody else, nor do they leave people saying "How did they spell that?".

LINUX QUESTIONS

 Hello again, 
                  well I finally figured out the illusive PPP with Linux. 
so what did id do once I logged on to my ISP through LINUX for the first 
time? Well I think to myself  "I'll go play on my favorite New Mexican 
Computer GRANDE!!" well of course like everything new in Linux it barked 
at me "Invalid Host Name" so I eventually figure out !!! wow I have to 
punch in the d*** DNS instead of the host NAME! well this brings me to 
my obvious question... HOW do I configure Finger , Telnet , Lynx etc.. 
to use Names instead of DNS #?

Set up your "/etc/resolv.conf" file.  It should look like this:

    domain your.isp. 
    search your.isp. 
    nameserver 123.456.789 
    nameserver 321.456.789 
  
You should be able to get the nameservers fairly easily from the instructions 
your ISP gave you for more main-stream stacks.  Remember the more nameservers 
you get, the better.  Note also the trailing dots on the names.

BTW sub 1: You can actually give anything you want on the "search" line.  It 
simply specifies what sub-domains to check for the DNS name to resolve 
before trying the whole 'net.

BTW sub 2: The numbers you would have to give are IP numbers, not DNS numbers.

BTW sub 3: Try looking at the LDP's (Linux Documentation Project) documents 
at http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP (152.2.254.81), or your local mirror.

Subject: linux ppd

i edited etc/resolv.conf and added the two DNS servers i connect to through 
my isp. i set up a pppd script in my home directory, opened minicom, dialed 
my isp, connected, exited without resetting my modem and ran my pppd script. 
it didn't give me any 'CONNECTED' messages, nothing. is it supposed to? than 
i tried running finger and ping to see if it was working, but they couldn't 
access anything i inputed. what the h*** is wrong!? and i'm having a h*** of 
a time getting x running on my computer, a toshiba pentium laptop. the thing 
is, it can run at 800x600 dual scan SVGA, but whenever i can actually get 
the x server to execute without any errors, the windows in a huge virtual 
window, and the resolution's about 320x200, if even. and i can't do 
anything, the whole window's blank, and when i use the mouse, the pop-up 
menu's too big to read, so it doesn't display correctly. also, are there 
anyother command-line modem apps for slackware, beside chat? can you suggest 
any good material for slackware? i got my version of linux with a book, 
Linux Unleashed. it s****. thanx.

i mean, if you really think about it . . .

It sounds like you have not set up /etc/resolv.conf or have not set it 
up correctly.  Basically you just have to put the following:

domain yourdomain.com 
nameserver yournamserver //this is numerical! 
nameserver anyothernameserveryourisphas

..First Linux virus reported

    Experts have long believed Unix immune to the sorts of viruses that 
    plague personal-computer operating systems, because its more robust 
    security model typically requires administrative privileges for 
    anyone trying to infect a system. An unknown party has now devel- 
    oped and released into the wild a virus-like program, called 
    "bliss," that has been proven to infect machines operating under 
    Linux (a free variant of Unix) without benefit of root privileges. 
    The perpetrator claims that the code is portable, so there is no- 
    thing limiting it only to attacking Linux systems -- "Bliss com- 
    piles clean (but was not run) on sunos, solaris, and openbsd," s/he 
    writes. I've posted the author's letter describing the virus [14] on 
    the TBTF Archive. MacAfee Software, developer of anti-virus tools, 
    has made available an antidote to bliss amid many press releases. 
    The company's public behavior has annoyed some in the security com- 
    munity who see it as grabbing credit it has not earned. I learned 
    about the virus from the 0xdeadbeef mailing list conducted by Glen 
    Macready <glen@substance.abuse.blackdown.org>.

PING QUESTION

(Please keep anonymous) 
 

I was wondering if PING (used with the -l argument) is comparable to PING 
with the -f argument, the flood ping.  I read the ping info page and it 
said something about -l sending a certain amount of packets as fast as 
possible before sending regular packets.  When you compare this to the -f 
switch (sending as many packets as fast as possible) it sounds similar. 
Couldn't someone make "-l" a huge number and use it for the same effect as 
-f?  Also, when I tried using -l on a server, after the pinging was done 
it said "82% packet loss".  Does this mean that I was slowing down the 
server (which was not what I was trying to do), or was it just ignoring 
me?

Thanks

RANDOM QUESTIONS

From: Frankie Hayes <strider@unix.aardvarkol.com>

Hey, 
 Post ONLY what follows:

 Hey... 
 Anyone know any proggys to password protect my HDD? My platform is MS-DOS 
6.20, and it's a 286, 1MB of RAM puter. I need it protected from someone 
that COULD get physical access to my box.

 Also, anyone have any documentation on how to nuke web pages??? I found a 
perverted kitty porn site i wanna take down...*PLEASE* e-mail me the 
docs!!! Thanx....

       Strider

Moderator: the legal way to take down Web sites with which you disagree is 
to identify where physically the Web server is located -- see the Guide to 
(mostly) Harmless Hacking Vol. 1 No. 6 -- How to Nuke Offensive Webs Sites? 
I show the legal procedure with step-by-step hacking techniques for getting 
rid of bad news stuff. I show myself getting mightily tempted by a buggy Web 
server, but backing off and doing the right thing.

If you want to turbo charge your study of legal hacker techniques to cut a 
bad news Web site off from the Internet, you may add to your arsenal the 
techniques in GTMHH Vol. 3 No. 2, "How to Map the Internet."

If what you are talking about is "kiddie porn" rather than "kitty porn," in 
most countries it is illegal. So once you identify the offending site, 
simply call the cops.  If you want to take down a site that is legal, 
however, I recommend advising the owner of the Web server of its existence 
and urging him or her to remove it. This is tremendously effective if in 
fact the Web site is seriously bad news. If this doesn't work, contact the 
company that provides Internet connectivity for that Web server.  And so on 
up the line.
