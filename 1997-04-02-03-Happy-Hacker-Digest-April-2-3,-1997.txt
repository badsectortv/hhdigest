IMHO [from the moderator Ruben D. Canlas Jr.] 
----------------------------------- 
I've been out of commission because of really pressing work. So I have 
to say my piece on Galf just now.

Let me clarify first that I am sympathetic to gays, working with a 
lot of them onstage (occasionally, I am a theater artist) and doing 
creative stuph. I am also averse to any form of censorship and do not 
follow Carolyn's religious beliefs.

However, when I volunteered to help out Carol in moderating the Happy 
Hacker, I agreed to play by Carol's rules, which I found reasonable. 
Carol convinced me that this is an international forum for newbie 
hackers -- some of our readers may not be able to dig the language and 
how it's said, hence the need for editing and bleeping. I guess 
bleeping is Carol's compromise too, because she doesn't totally delete 
the cusswords and you can still get an idea what the cusswords were 
;).

One basic tenet of freedom of expression is that you can always choose 
not to read/participate in something you don't like. In between these 
extremes, we can always make compromises. Since I liked the Happy 
Hacker Digest, but didn't like censoring the curses, I decided to 
accept a compromise and go ahead helping the digest.

The point is, Carol left it for me to decide whether I should help or 
not. She did not tell me to get lost or stop participating in the 
digest.

This is basic Freedom: you choose what you want to do, and you can do 
it as long as it does not cause other people harm. You also respect 
other people's freedoms. Freedom and power entail lots of 
responsibility. Since hackers are free and powerful, they need to 
realize that sense of responsibility.

What makes me disapprove of the Galf attack? Happy Hacker is a newbie 
digest, for god's sake, and it wants to distribute free information to 
all budding hackers. To attack it is to attack what Happy Hacker 
represents: freedom of information.

Happy Hacker never once tried to force any religious belief into any 
of its issues. If moral debates and contrary opinions were raised, the 
digest never suppressed it and in fact encouraged debate.

So IMHO, the Galf attack was lame because the Happy Hacker Digest was 
the wrong target. Galf should pick on people their own size, or since 
they seem like brave kids, someone bigger -- like maybe military sites 
or microsoft.

INFOWAR FORUM ERRORS 
---------------------------

From: hedrek@wantree.com.au

I want to use the infowar forum, but it is still a mass of 500 errors 
etc. Is there a problem with the site or could it be my system? Any 
advice much appreciated.

Carolyn: We are negotiating with the ISP that maintains it to please, 
please install more memory. The errors come when too many people 
access it at once and there isn't enough memory to hold all the 
processes so it starts swapping stuff back and forth from disk and, 
well, we are using Win NT, enough said. But -- GALF has never hacked 
the infowar server on account of they don't know the first thing about 
NT, so it does have its advantages.

More than likely, tcsh isn't the shell you have on your system.  You 
need to know the exact path of the shell (/usr/bin/csh, /bin/sh, etc). 
 What sysadmins normally do is disable direct use of a shell for an 
editor, which is why you have to use a shell script, such as above.

Try replacing /usr/local/bin/tcsh with /bin/sh, and try again.  It 
will work, you just need to massage it a bit.

HELP FOR TELNET AND FINGER 
--------------------------------------

From: CaBzTag@aol.com

I read the list of things to  try to do to try to finger or telnet and 
every time I try either it will say "cannot retrieve http..........."

so I am using AOL and I don't know if this has anything to do with it 
because it is not saying "access denied" or any type of message that 
is letting me know I am forbidden. I used to have Netcom but.... My 
mom thought that she got rid of it but the actual account is still 
active but.....

In Config PPP I lost all the info so I can't get on to it anymore. So 
if you know the stats for config PPP, please help me, and I also need 
the stas for the Internet Dialer. do you think it is because i am 
using AOL??????

well this is my first time ever trying to telnet or finger so i might 
be doing something wrong. the other thing is i dont have a shell 
account and I was wondering if you could set me up w/one thanks for 
your time in reading this. Even though u think I'm probably another 
loser who will just do something stupid and get in trouble!

MY SO-CALLED SHELL ACCT 
-------------------------------------- 
From: Twigz Wiggy <twiggy@hq.tcfarm.com>

The sysop at my ISP sayz I have a shell account and he told me I just 
have to telnet into the server and that's it. but when I telnet, a 
window comes up with some options (Pine, Tin, an FTP thing, etc.)  But 
I can't find anything about how I can type in thingz like 'telnet-> 
boring.isp.net 80' I can surf around with my telnet program but I 
can't use the 'shell account' that your talkin about (I am a newbie... 
therefore I could be wrong :) I was just wonderin if you could help me 
out to figure out if I actually do have a Shell account or not.  If so 
I would really appreciate it (: 
        -Twigz 
PS:I just found out about yur e-zine gtmhh from Silicon toadz website

through 2-1 I have more than that on my computer though (: anyway... 
laterz

benc: twigz, by the looks of it, you have a telnet account running a 
menu program. look for an option that says Exit to Shell or something. 
or go ask your sysop!

GUIDE TO SOCIAL ENGINEERING

From: hwsnyman@medic.up.ac.za (LiquidMetal) 
 

Hi there again!

I have a few more things on my mind that only you can tell me...

1 - Is it possible to get ROOT access through TELNET? If so, how would 
I go about doing it? 2 - Do you have a "Guide to Social Engineering", 
or something like that? I am     REALLY interested in learning more 
about it.

Thanx

SCANNING PORTS

Not sure about netcop, but I'm using pscan under linux.. I *think* 
what it generally means is that yes those ports are open, kind of.. 
For example if I got back ..

5376 (ftp) is running. 
5888 (telnet) is running. 
etc etc.. More standard service but on weird ports..

I'd *assume* that it's a firewall running port redirection, as when I 
telnet to one of these service on the standard port I get exactly what 
I'd expect to see if the scan had showed smtp on port 25..

Hope this clears up the subject a bit..

Hi!

Sometimes it's not enough to use anonymizers to be anonymous. If you 
use java, then you are vunerable (more details were revealed on one of 
the security lists, but I can't remember which one right now).

Just so everyone is clear, this is not me at all. At least two people have 
made the mistake 
of assuming it is me since this person is 'Damien' too.

Please don't forget your repeated posts about how we should fear your (and 
Winn's) 
FBI/SS/NSA/CIA/NAACP/whatever friends. Why should I be terrified of them 
when I am 
only posting to a list? Why do you bring that up as some form of a quasi-threat 
every week or so?

And why do you never directly answer my questions?

>From warhead@juno.com

>Hmmm, you are looking for a fight aren't you?  Well, unfortunately not all

No. I am looking for the truth. Something that she seems to want to disguise.

>of us suffer from what you do - A huge pre-pubescent ego.  I know it may

Oh, so I have an ego for correcting such careless mistakes such as the one 
Carolyn and 
others are making? Whatever.

>seem odd to you, Jericho, but *GOOD* hackers don't go picking fights so they 
>can boost their egos but rather use their knowledge mostly in defense from

In defense from people like me. What hacking skills can you use to defend 
against 
my posts to this list? You sound as ignorant as the other person who made 
too many wild 
assumptions. Let me also take this moment to remind you and the others that 
you don't 
have the first clue about my hacking skills. I may know nothing, or I may be 
fairly decent. 
My entire existance on this list has been to clear up mostly non-technical 
errors. 
Occasionally when Carolyn goes out of her way to post up something halfway 
technical, 
I will correct that too as it is usually wrong.

>e-mail address.  Yes, I CAN subscribe you to hundreds of list-servs.  The 
>thing is, that doesn't take a brain!  Laughing at people like you and having

Oh. Threaten to mailbomb me for my opinion.. and you call ME a lamer? I have 
never said 
it takes a lot of know-how to mailbomb. I have simply defended their right 
to express 
their opinion wether or not I agree with their means. I happen to agree in 
their case 
this time. "I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the 
death your right 
to say it." - Voltaire

>pride in your abilities and knowing when to use them does.  If you'd like to 
>continue this in e-mail, feel free.

Why? You seem too unwilling to read my messages and accept them for what 
they are. From 
what I can tell, you seem too quick to jump to inaccurate conclusions.

>If you'd like to mail-bomb me there, feel free!  Really!  I would be 
>overjoyed if you would because then you would simply prove to everyone 
>on this list how much of a lamer you really are.  Now, if you'd like

>Juno's minor security defenses.  Catch you all later

As I was saying above.. why do you assume I would mailbomb you? I haven't 
mailbombed 
anyone on this list (or any other) for any reason, especially not for 
expressing their 
opinion (which you are doing now). If I were to mailbomb anyone, don't you 
think I 
would have hit Carolyn a while back? As for the "how much of a lamer you 
really are" 
comment, I don't know what to say to you. Maybe that you shouldn't judge me 
because you 
know nothing of me? Or maybe that if you consider me with my skills lame, 
then it speaks 
volumes about your ineptness? Or just laugh at you as another 'juno' user 
that doesn't 
apparently even have a shell account to play with yourself? You pick 
whatever makes 
you happy. I will sit back here at work doing exploitation and security 
research.

But they have insinuated that I am a member, or the person responsible for

or other things. See below for a quote from the last digest.

Thank you for pointing that out to our less than cluefull members.

And you wonder why I think YOU are starting these assumptions?

Carolyn: Your last post was hard to read in any other way than as a threat 
to commit a computer crime against the University of Texas at El Paso. Your 
corrections of technical errors that people post on this list are generally 
typos or gripes about wording that could be misinterpreted, for which we 
thank you for your sharp editorial talents. If you wish at some point to 
begin posting highly technical tutorials of the quality we get from, for 
example, Bronc Buster, you may find that the readers of this list will take 
you more seriously as a real hacker and not just a knee-jerk sympathizer 
with the criminal element.

I guess I'm gonna PO everyone on this list. Jericho is right! Not only 
"b******* opinions" and "innacurate technical information", but, Carolyn likes 
to disguise it as being "legal hacking". Alot of the stuff on this list will 
have you at the least searching for a new ISP. In addition, while I don't 
advocate massive mail-bombing, I agree with angry johnny when he said that 
Carolyn is giving the newbies just enough rope to hang themselves with. I don't 
know GALF. I don't know what they want. So why should I "bring them down 
legally" or even bother with them? I'm not gonna sit here and make judgements 
about jericho or GALF just because the moderator of this list happens not to 
like them. Alot of people like to post to this forum and say "jericho's scared" 
or crap like that. Please, do tell, what's he to be afraid of?? Is a gang of 
HappyHackers going to break into his computer and change the "Its now safe to 
shutdown your computer." message?? Or (gasp!) change the animated logo on his 
web-browser? Of course, that would require 2 weeks of discussion in this forum, 
so he'd probably catch on.

Carolyn: Intergalactic is right, thanks to the bad name groups like GALF 
have given to us hackers, even doing legal harmless stuff can oftentimes get 
you booted off your ISP.  As for giving newbies just enough rope to hang 
themselves, I'm flattered that Intergalatic thinks we are teaching enough to 
get into trouble with. Some 31337 d00dz have been complaining that all we do 
around here is teach rudimentary Unix and Windows. Meanwhile, will you 
newbies please remember that if you are learning hacking by reading this, 
you don't know enough to successfully cover your tracks if you were to 
commit a computer crime.

 *** What's Up with the Headers? 
=========================================================================

From: n-treeg@ix.netcom.com

Hey Caroline, I just got the latest issue of Happy Hacker Digest, but the 
headers look strange.  Can you tell me why the e-mail is apparently routed 
through escape.com?  Isn't that Netta Gilboa and her crew?  Whats up?

Carolyn: I'm doing this to irritate GALF. Now what I'm waiting for is for 
someone on this list to be elite enough to figure out exactly what I'm doing 
with Happy Hacker mail. Who around here is a wizard at deciphering headers? 
Oh, and that guy on the dcstuff list who thought the root@escape.com in a 
header meant something terrible, no, that's just what you get on any 
undeliverable mail message from escape.com. One of these days I have got to 
write that GTMHH on how to read headers!
