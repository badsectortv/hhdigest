Subject: Hacker war 
:

Some of you on this list have wondered why we have been quiet so long. 
Here's the answer: HACKER WAR!

Yes, you've read about hacker wars in Wired. Now you can play in them, 
too -- on this list.

Guaranteed. All the hairiest, scariest hackers on the planet lurk this 
list, waiting to pounce on us.

Now if you don't want some hypersensitive famous hacker raising heck with 
you for something you post to this list, send it to me 
(cmeinel@techbroker.com) and request confidentiality. I'll post your item 
anonymously.

In the meantime, we'll take back up where we left off. Just as we closed 
down and moved the list due to, um, "technical difficulties," two 
well-known hackers (and some lesser known ones) were flaming me on this 
list. Well, we carried on some fun and games via private email and later 
on the dc-stuff hackers' list.

So following is one of our little exchanges. It is between Gregory 
Gillis, who specializes in viruses, and myself.

WARNING! If you are humor impaired, DO NOT READ THIS. IT WILL GIVE YOU 
ULCERS! Remember, I warned you.

Furthermore, second warning, while the following is almost entirely true, 
it is embellished just a tiny bit. This is known as satire.

causes.

Greg, oh, Greg, how soon you forget! Remember that romantic evening at 
Def Con III? Back 9in 1995? I had just plugged my laptop into a phone 
jack lurking in the ballroom wall. You moved closer and whispered, 
"Carolyn, teach me how to forge email."

Gregory, it was ecstasy. We telneted to fantasia.idec.sdl.usu.edu 25. How 
I remember her! An Indigo pining away in Logan, Utah. A lonely, tiny 
little Mormon town far in space and in the moral universe from our steamy 
Las Vegas ballroom. Our excitement grew as you breathlessly keyed in 
those commands: HELO...MAIL FROM:...RCPT TO: ... DEBUG...DEBUG! DEBUG!!! 
Fantasia, Fantasia, FANTASIA!!!

Then, remember, Gregory, you asked for a memento of our little telnet 
session. A text file. Yes, a text file explaining how to forge email by 
telneting to a port running simple mail transfer protocol. I gave it to 
you on a floppy disk.

Then you gave me a little memento, too. A disk with zipped viruses. And a 
cute little pkunzip executable. An executable that, when I ran it, 
trashed every file on your disk. Gregory, I still have that disk, a 
priceless keepsake of our evening together at Def Con III.

But then, Gregory, it all began to fall apart. Later at Def Con III you 
were *selling* copies of that disk with my email forging instructions on 
it. Gregory! That was OUR email forging secret!

Well, Gregory, after you began peddling *our* email forging hack, I 
figured I might as well go all the way. I began hanging out on street 
corners after dark. Accosting passing motorists. "Wanna hack? Latest 
sendmail exploit, 50 bucks! OK, $25. All right, all right, 25 cents..."

So now you see me. The Happy Hacker. Just wait until the Jan. Penthouse 
comes out. I'll show you, Gregory, you cad, you cad!

[First of a series of replies to the Happy Hackers files. Input was taken 
 from a handful of people and organized by Disorder and se7en. All replies 
 should be directed to either dc-stuff@dis.org or hh@cibola.net]

No. It is not easy. It takes a lot of time to learn systems, learn 
security concepts associated with multi-user environments, etc.

Your statement goes along with that of some clueless person who posted 
the following statement to USENET: "Any three-year old can just pop in a 
CD and start hacking these days." Ludicrous. Learning how a system works, 
communicates, interacts between all of it's different parts, and between 
other systems, is how one learns to hack. Also knowing programming 
languages is almost essential in learning how to apply the exploits once 
they are found. All of this takes time. A long time.

>But regardless of why you want to be a hacker, it is definitely a way to 
>have fun, impress your buddies, and get dates. If you are a female hacker 
>you become totally irresistible to all men. Take my word for it!;^D

This is so insipid.

Geez: "I wanna be a hacker to express my misplaced adolescent angst!" It 
use to be car gangs, surfer/hesher rivalries, then gangs. Now it's 
"hacker groups." Getting a life would be better. And that should say 
"to a handful of repressed men".

>So what do you need to become a hacker? Before I tell you, however, I am 
>going to subject you to a rant.

And more to come, each to push your own views and beliefs on others, 
while giving them less than adequate technical details.

See my first response above to see what you really need to become a 
hacker. Knowledge and an intense desire to read, learn and experiment. 
That is what hacking really is. Not listening to lamers who 
have no hacking foundation to rest on, yet professes to know enough to 
teach others how to hack. Teachers must know their subject to teach 
others.

>Yes, some of these 3l1te types like to flame the newbies. They act like they 
>were born clutching a Unix manual in one hand and a TCP/IP specification 
>document in the other and anyone who knows less is scum.

No. They have taken a lot of time to learn the ins and outs of networks, 
operating systems, protocols, and more. They do not want to just hand 
over everything they have achieved to some clueless new person who 
recently saw the movie "hackers".

A statement made to attempt to insulate herself from emails such as these 
in the eyes of her newbie students so she can save face. Is anyone 
actually learning anything useful, and actually applying them to real 
world successful hacks? Or is everybody just wasting away their life with 
delusions of hacking grandeur? No one will learn how to hack from the 
Happy Hackers list/files in its current state. Period.

>the word "elite" or "eleet" and substitute numbers for some or all the

No. The real hackers do not do this regularly. The few times they do, 
they do it as a joke or to mock others who think it is cool.

>What we worry about is the kind of guy who says, "I want to become a hacker. 
>But I *don't* want to learn programming and operating systems. Gimme some 
>passwords, d00dz! Yeah, and credit card numbers!!!"

And you wonder why hackers are quick to flame these kind of people?

Lamers get credit card numbers to be able to freely call places like the 
Defcon voice bridge, which is about as lame as it gets, and has nothing 
to do with hacking.

>How can a clueless newbie trash other people's computers? Easy. There are 
>public FTP and Web sites on the Internet that offer canned hacking programs.

The canned hacker programs you speak of do not delete or 'trash' systems. 
A clueless newbie can do it by mistyping a simple command. Rather than 
typing "rm -f", they might type "rm -rf" and do much more damage than 
they had planned.

Recently reviewing the code of many of these programs, an overwhelming 
majority of them do not work, and are outdated. What few do work require 
source code modification to work properly against the intended target. 
They are just plain too old, and take advantage of exploits that have 
long since been patched. Your generalizations about hacking are the same 
things the media does, and they have demonstrated, as have you, that they 
know nothing.

>Thanks to these canned tools, many of the "hackers" you read about getting 
>busted are in fact clueless newbies.

Clueless newbies like you. I have yet to see anything of substance from 
anything you have ever written yet, including your lame and dodgeful 
replies to these emails. The people you speak of are not hackers, nor were 
they considered hackers.

>This column will teach you how to do real, yet legal and harmless hacking,

Telling people how to crash machines is not harmless Carolyn. (see later 
issues)

And how about if I have a ppp account, and connect my linux box to that

vague responses are completely worthless. Unix is very specific, vague 
teaching will not help anyone.

Look at other groups that give vague responses.. like psychic hotlines, 
politicians, etc. Vague replies are often a method of trying to hide 
true ignorance.

Excuse me? No. Hackers do not buy 'Dummies' books. They would rather choose 
"TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 1-3". Maybe you should read some of these 
reference books yourself.

>OK, I'm signing off for this column. And I promise to tell you more about

So we learned to telnet to three ports, and do basic commands. Once again, 
this is not hacking.

Yeah, so where was the file promising to tell us what the big deal over 
telnetting to finger? There is no big deal. Maybe to you, but in 
objective reality, there is none.

So why copyright this Carolyn?

I've been asking her this for months now. She finally answered it. She is 
out to commercialize and make a buck from hacking. She doesn't know 
anything about it, so she might as well cash in and be a hacking whore 
like so many others are doing these days.

Happy Hacker Digest 
Sender: owner-hh@cibola.net 
Precedence: bulk

We've had some requests for a digest format. So I'm going to try putting the 
creme de la creme of input to this list in one email per day for awhile. 
Let me know how this works.

If you want to unsubscribe, email majordomo@cibola.net with message 
"unsubscribe hh"

Moderator's note: this first one gets POST OF THE DAY award! Since he sent 
this to me rather than the list, I have anonymized it. Remember, if you want 
credit for your posts, please send them to the list, not to me.

Hi Caroline, 
May every blessing be heaped upon you for coming out with this Happy Hacker 
mother lode of info. Many, many thanks. 
 Windows' Telnet: I've been able to telnet to a specific port -- in fact 
that's how I ran the fake email stunt, sending a very happy little girl a 
letter from Santa. (Much wonderment; who said hacking had to be 
baaaaaaad!!??) 
Speaking of Santa: He's gonna be bringing me the book "Running Linux" with 
the accompanying CD Rom, which has a Linux system as well as a GNU (?) 
personal C compiler. (Yes, I'm taking your advice on that and trying to 
learn C, too. If my 50-y-o brain goes KAZ-art! my lawyers will be in touch. 
And they're Canadians. Whoooo--ooooh.) 
I guess my questions are (finally, Mabel, he's gotta question): 
1. Will that be a suitable Linux? 
2. Should I try for another? 
3. What is the meaning of life? 
4. If yes, is that shaken or stirruped? 
Finally, thanks again for all your work/effort/labor/of/love. Perhaps I'll 
hear from you .... 
Alan

Moderator's answers:

1) You poor, poor thing. You're going to install Linux for Christmas? I've 
found alcohol aids the process.

2) Some people find that Redhat is the easiest brand of Linux to install. 
But I had a horrible time with it. Walnut Creek Slackware was easiest for 
me. I of course am speaking relatively when I call it "easiest."

3) The meaning of life is 42. Scientists recently verified this through a 
determination of the Hubble Constant.

4) Booze consumed while installing Linux should be inhaled along with 
nitrous oxide. It is absorbed faster through the membranes of the lungs. 
Trust me on this, I am also an expert in human physiology.

    The fact that I was able to write my own script to go through the WWW 
access logs, and not only tell me how many hits my site received but also 
the exact address of the visitor, what files they looked at and at what 
times.  I suppose you might be able to do this with NT or another OS, but 
the fact of the matter is that if you usually don't pay for that type of 
report you won't be able to get it.  That is the case with our ISP ($25 a 
month for web tracking with tons less info than I can generate for free).

    Unix is definitely the most flexible and 'low level' operating system 
that I've been exposed to.  Unfortunately, that scares some people 
because it allows their users to do more than they might want them to. 
Sadly this is the situation here.  Our management has been scared into 
thinking that WinNT is the only real safe OS and wants to get rid of Unix 
altogether..

Hail! 
Nothing goes on in DC-Stuff except flame wars, basically, so you might 
wanna warn future subscribers of that.  There are discussions on why SF 
is better than any city in the modern world, and in the weeks leading up 
to the con there are discussions about trips/rides there, but that's 
about it.  Almost as high noise/signal ratio cypherpunks, and the little 
signal is not as good, I think... 
 

(Another anonymous post) 
 

You may want to remind people that ping and traceroute are included 
with Windows95.  They have to be accessed through a DOS window while a 
PPP connection is active.

For ping, at the command prompt, the command is "ping."

For traceroute, since DOS is still limited to 8 character filenames, 
the command is "tracert".

The general command line options apply.

As to Jericho's comment: 
>I know you can get some of these utils for DOS, but even then.. it just 
>isn't the same. This is the second time I have seen you try to justify 
>keeping Windows95 if you want to become a "hacker". That is just wrong.

Carolyn has never said Win95 and the available apps for it are an 
acceptable substitute for a shell account or running a PPP connection 
through Linux, but not everyone is as elite as you Jericho.  She has 
merely given solutions for those not able to or not ready to move up to 
those levels.

Why does it have to be an either-or proposition?  Win95 and Linux can 
co-exist peacefully on the same hard drive.  I can't afford to go 
hunting for and buying a bunch of productivity applications (like 
bitmap editors on a par with PhotoShop, a word processor on a par with 
MS Word, etc.) for Linux.  Win 95 just has more of the software I need 
available.  Plus, I had drivers for my video card when I got Win95. 
Support for my video card wasn't added to Xfree86 until the 3.1.2G 
beta, and wasn't officially added until the 3.2 release last month.

Linux has its uses, thus I've given it a few hundred megs spread 
across my two hard drives (how many of the HH subscribers are old 
enough to remember when a 5 meg hard drive in a PC was high-tech?  We 
got a Sperry PC clone in the computer lab at my high school in '84 and 
we thought that internal 5 megger was just the coolest - as opposed to 
the 160k 5.25" floppies we otherwise had to use --- major nostalgia, I 
used to do my AP Computer Science homework using Turbo Pascal on a 
Commodore 64).

I see no reason why encouraging newbies and tentative hackers to get 
their feet wet in Win95 first is wrong, or why having both OS's is a 
bad thing.

It may be pre-school level stuff in your opinion, but how many people 
were coloring inside the lines at three?  Cut Carolyn and the newer 
people some slack.  Just getting Linux up and running is a real 
challenge for some people.  Configuring the programs and services 
necessary for higher-level hacking can be a real bear, even for people 
who have some familiarity with UNIX from work or shell accounts.  Let 
people move at their own speed.  They'll get there.

The relationship between dimensional and lemming is pretty basic. 
lemming gets its dedicated service from dimensional. No conspiracy 
theories there.

port 22 responds with SSH and a version number.. could that be.. no.. 
*gasp*.. Secure Shell? You know.. a little application that allows secure 
telnets to a machine? I would hardly classify that as "wide open". 
However, if you do manage to break through port 22, and defeat SSH, please 
write a white paper on it for the next Phrack.

(Editor's note: I'm afraid that http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh/#further-info has 
beaten Phrack to the punch with  a description of how to break into 
Jericho's computer. YOU CAN GO TO PRISON NOTE: in Colorado, breaking into 
the computer of someone who has not given you permission to do so is a FELONY.)

Why does it have most of its ports shut down? Lemme think.. maybe because 
most aren't needed? What should I enable beyond ftp, telnet, ssh, and 
sendmail? Nothing. There is no need for 99% of the services offered on a 
unix box, at least for me.

(I was asking why dimensional.com is wide open, not lemming.com.)

So by not enabling these other daemons, I am making my box "more secure". 
Are we following yet?

Oh, and Carolyn, feel free to portscan my box until your heart is content.

was a good girl and did not put the "#" prompt on my screen. But -- I never 
said I was some sort of a super hacker, did I? I merely teach beginner 
hacking. You and Phrack editor daemon9 are the guys who are so worried 
someone might think I actually know something about hacking.)

I believe I am posting correctly, if not forgive me.  I am normally not a 
fan of mailing lists.  There is a telnet program for windows that will let 
you telnet to any port you like.  I'm sure you have heard of it, it is 
called Netterm.  Although I am an avid supporter and user of linux, Netterm 
is the best telnet program available when stuck in windows.

Hi there.  Just wanted to point out a Web-based WHOIS service, provided by 
the InterNIC itself.  The web page address is 
<http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois>.  The also list there some good 
instructions on other good snooping tools like nslookup.

BTW: Here's some info that may or may not be use to your readers - do with 
it as you will.  I'm not any expert hacker by any means, so you may want to 
double-check if everything is correct...

----------- 
If you want to get a list of all the computers that are available at a site, 
try the following:

If you have an email address or a domain name, you can find all the 
computers hosted in that subnet.  In the example of an e-mail address, let's 
use my address as an example - <sferrier@achilles.net>.

"achilles.net" is the domain name.  So, from a UNIX command-prompt, type 
"nslookup".  This will give you something that looks a little like this 
(less the dotted lines):

---------- 
Default Server:  nic.achilles.net 
Address:  198.53.206.6

> 
----------

The ">" character is your new prompt.  If you type "?", you should get a 
help screen that looks something like:

---------- 
$Id: nslookup.help,v 4.9.1.3 1993/12/06 00:43:17 vixie Exp $

Commands:       (identifiers are shown in uppercase, [] means optional) 
NAME            - print info about the host/domain NAME using default server 
NAME1 NAME2     - as above, but use NAME2 as server 
help or ?       - print info on common commands; see nslookup(1) for details 
set OPTION      - set an option 
    all         - print options, current server and host 
    [no]debug   - print debugging information 
    [no]d2      - print exhaustive debugging information 
    [no]defname - append domain name to each query 
    [no]recurse - ask for recursive answer to query 
    [no]vc      - always use a virtual circuit 
    domain=NAME - set default domain name to NAME 
    srchlist=N1[/N2/.../N6] - set domain to N1 and search list to N1,N2, etc. 
    root=NAME   - set root server to NAME 
    retry=X     - set number of retries to X 
    timeout=X   - set initial time-out interval to X seconds 
    querytype=X - set query type, e.g., A,ANY,CNAME,HINFO,MX,NS,PTR,SOA,TXT,WKS 
    type=X      - synonym for querytype 
    class=X     - set query class to one of IN (Internet), CHAOS, HESIOD or ANY 
server NAME     - set default server to NAME, using current default server 
lserver NAME    - set default server to NAME, using initial server 
finger [USER]   - finger the optional NAME at the current default host 
root            - set current default server to the root 
ls [opt] DOMAIN [> FILE] - list addresses in DOMAIN (optional: output to FILE) 
    -a          -  list canonical names and aliases 
    -h          -  list HINFO (CPU type and operating system) 
    -s          -  list well-known services 
    -d          -  list all records 
    -t TYPE     -  list records of the given type (e.g., A,CNAME,MX, etc.) 
view FILE       - sort an 'ls' output file and view it with more 
exit            - exit the program, ^D also exits 
----------

There are all sorts of goodies in there.  But, to concentrate on getting 
those machine names...

First, you want to find out the name server (the machine that will hold the 
list of all the computers that have dedicated addresses) for that domain. 
To find that out, try the following:

---------- 
> set quertype=mx 
> achilles.net 
Server:  nic.achilles.net 
Address:  198.53.206.6

achilles.net    preference = 5, mail exchanger = mailhost.achilles.net 
achilles.net    preference = 20, mail exchanger = mail.ottawa.istar.net 
achilles.net    nameserver = nic.achilles.net 
achilles.net    nameserver = nic.fonorola.net 
mailhost.achilles.net   internet address = 198.53.206.6 
mail.ottawa.istar.net   internet address = 204.191.213.2 
nic.achilles.net        internet address = 198.53.206.6 
nic.fonorola.net        internet address = 198.53.64.7 
> 
----------

The "set quertype=mx" line tells it that you want to know what route 
incoming mail would take to get it.  It also gives us some other usefull 
information.  For example, you can tell from this who is the ISP for my ISP 
- namely <istar.net>.  It tells you that incoming mail will be routed to the 
machine <mailhost.achilles.net>.  It also tells you the master DNS 
nameserver - <nic.achilles.net>.  Now that we know the nameserver, try this:

---------- 
> server nic.achilles.net 
Default Server:  nic.achilles.net 
Address:  198.53.206.6

> 
----------

This will tell it to disconnect from your local DNS and connect to the 
remote DNS server for the domain in question.  From here, try this:

---------- 
>ls achilles.net 
----------

And presto!  You have a list of all the computers in their sub-net that have 
dedicated addresses!  Now, more often than not, many of the names in here 
will be useless - ie: they will be for dialup accounts or whatnot, or 
perhaps have multiple names for the same IP address, but you will most 
definately come up with at least a few good machine names to play with. 
Some sites will give you a list of literally hundreds of entries.  For 
these, it would be much more usefull to have the date stored in a file 
rather than displayed to the screen.  To accomplish this, simply modify the 
above command to read:

---------- 
>ls achilles.net > achilles.txt 
[nic.achilles.net] 
####### 
Received 370 records. 
> 
----------

This will store all the retrieved data into the file "achilles.txt" in the 
current directory.  It also nicely tells you how many names were obtained 
:-)  To quit "nslookup", simply enter the command "exit".

For more fun, try "set quertype=hinfo", then entering one of the specific 
machine names that you found!

Have fun!
