Okay, another issue of the HHD is on the way!!  Seems last issue, 
several people took offense at the quote that I said came from 
the Bible.  Okay, I apologize.  I don't know that it came from 
the Bible...I've heard the quote for years, and never thought to 
look it up.  However, very little was said about the technical 
portion of the Digest, so things went rather well!!

>From "NoWorries" <noworries@telia.com>:

Seems NoWorries (bet his ISP is in the Down Under) sent in an 
email regarding a product that he'd seen...go to:

http://www.telusplanet.net/public/don1/netbus.html

Evidently, this is a superior NetBus scanner, allegedly better 
than the scanner that comes with NetBus itself.  I downloaded it 
in the wee hours this fine morn...and it seemed to run fine. 
This scanner also allegedly changes the password for you...so one 
could potentially hijack someone else's NetBus.  It's definitely 
worth a look.  Just keep in mind...you have to download the 
original version before you d/l the update...

Subject: HTML virus patch available for MS Internet Explorer 
Date: Mon, 28 Dec 1998 13:03:44 -0800

Due to last weeks debacle (Remote Explorer) and all the unnecessary 
hype, I was actually unable to send this information out on time. 
The truth is the fallout from remote explorer has still got me under 
water however this info must be delivered in a timely manner.

Last week Microsoft's Internet Explorer team released a patch that 
addresses 1Internal's HTML viruses specifically the HTML.worm where 
the virus author exploited a security bug in IE. The patch is called 
"Frame Spoof" and can be obtained from 
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/security/default.asp. 
I know this gets confusing...the fact is this patch incorporates all 
the prior patches available for IE and is the only one needed for a 
completely patched system (from an Internet Explorer stand point)... 
hope that helps clear some confusion!

More information:

Internet Explorer 3.X and 4.0 
----------------------------- 
Internet Explorer 3.X and 4.0 users must first upgrade to Internet 
Explorer 4.01 with Service Pack 1, which is available at 
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/. After installing the 
upgrade, apply the Internet Explorer 4.01 patch as discussed above.

Internet Explorer 4.01 
---------------------- 
Customers using Internet Explorer 4.01 (with or without Service Pack 1) 
can obtain the patch from the Internet Explorer Security 
web site, (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/security/spoof.asp).

Macintosh & Solaris 
---------------------- 
The patches for the Macintosh, HPUX and Solaris versions will be 
slightly delayed. When they are available, a notice will be posted 
on http://www.microsoft.com/ie/security/. 
 

Please inform your customers who are concerned about this issue and 
point them to the available patch. As always, feel free to ping me if 
you have any issues concerning this patch.

[NOTE:  I made the call to withhold the author's personal info... 
I didn't have his permission to release it.]

Internet Protocols

Want to find out a little more about Internet protocols?  Wondering 
what to do next when you telnet to port 80 on a web server?  Well, 
check out...

http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Communications_and_ 
Networking/Protocols/

Now, just about everything on the Internet is documented in 
some form or another.  The most popular and indepth form is the 
Request For Comments, or RFCs.  The documents range in topic and 
content.  Sites to begin looking at RFCs include:

http://www.csl.sony.co.jp/rfc/ 
http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/rfcietf.html 
http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/information/rfc.html

Go to these sites (or a variety of others) and read up on the 
real-deal, with regards to Internet protocols, etc.

****************************************************************** 
SNMP Explained

If you've examined the topic of networking at all, you've likely 
come across the SNMP protocol.  SNMP stands for the "Simple Network 
Management Protocol".  Back in the mid- to late-'80's, a protocol 
was needed to manage network devices, such as routers, switches, 
etc.  The interim solution was SNMP, but that solution caught on 
so well that the follow-on protocol was all but abandoned.

This is how SNMP works...the management station (MS) has SNMP tools 
for making queries.  The managed devices (MD) have 'agents' running 
on them...small daemons that just sit and wait for requests.  When 
the MS sends a request (SNMP uses the UDP protocol) to the agent on 
the MD, the agent consults it's managed information base (MIB) for 
the information and sends the response back to the MS.  The MIB is 
essentially a database that resides on the device.  Also, given 
particule conditions, the MD can send a 'trap' to the MS, alerting 
the MS to some condition.

Here's an example of the communications that takes place:

   [MS]   --->  SNMP query (UDP, port 161)  --->  [MD]

   [MS]   <---  SNMP response (UPD)         <---  [MD]

These queries and responses are referred to as 'polling'.  The 
MS 'polls' the MD for information.

   [MS]   <---  SNMP trap (UPD, port 162)   <---  [MD]

This communication is referred to as a 'trap'.  The MD finds that 
a particular condition has been met, and sends a message to the 
MS.  This form of communication is also used by intrusion detection 
systems to tie into the network management system...

Now, here's some particulars regarding SNMP.  The first version, 
SNMP v1, is probably the most widely used version.  Some systems 
seem to install and enable SNMP with little or no input from the 
user.  Cisco routers simply require that the entry for SNMP be 
marked yes or no, for example.

As I said, the MIB is essentially a database of managed information. 
The MIB contains information about various aspects of the system... 
the number of IP packets to go in and out of an interface (NIC), 
the number of TCP reconnect requests, who to contact if there's a 
problem, and the routing table for the interface.  Each piece of 
information is referenced by an object identifier or 'OID'.  When 
you want a particular piece of information, you make the request 
for the particular OID.  Now, these OIDs are long sequences of single 
digits separated by dots...which is why there are tools that let you 
choose the information you want, and substitutes the particular OID 
into the request for you.  Two of these tools are WS_Ping Pro from 
IPSwitch, and the Java SNMP classes and demo application from 
Advent Network Management (see URLs below).

Here's an example OID...for the system uptime (how long since the 
last reboot of the managed object) you need to request:

sysUpTime or OID '1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0'

Hhhhmmm...which would be easier to remember?

One of the configuration options for SNMP is something called the 
'community string'.  This is a piece of information that, w/ SNMP 
v1, is passed on the UDP datagrams in plain text, and is used as 
a sort of password.  For the query to be valid, the community string 
must be correct.  Well, like many things on the Internet, this option 
is left at it's default value...'public'.

SNMP v1 has three types of requests...get, get-next, and set.  Because 
of the extreme lack of security, many systems do not implement the 
set capability...Cisco and Microsoft's versions come to mind.  However, 
using the get and get-next capability, you can get all sorts of great 
information.  By using get-next requests, you can get the routing tables

for the interface (NIC).  Using just the get request, you can get 
information on the number of IP/ICMP/TCP/UDP packets to go in and out 
of the interface.  You can get the system contact and information 
strings.

In this Digest, I am not going to go into great detail about the 
various types of managed objects, or the various vendor-specific 
MIBs that are available.  My intention has been to provide a brief 
overview of SNMP, and hopefully spark your interest for further 
investigation.  I am not going to give you a list, but there are 
many sites on the Internet that think they are secure, but they 
allow SNMP datagrams to travel in and out of their networks.  So 
imagine walking into one of these company offices and handing them 
a map of their network...which you developed by using a Java-based 
SNMP tool that your wrote!!

Use any of the links to RFCs from the 'Internet Protocols' 
section above to look for RFC 1157, regarding SNMP.

For Perl programmers, I found a Perl module at CPAN, written by 
David M. Town <dtown@fore.com>, which is really great!  You 
don't need to have the CMU SNMP package installed...all you need 
to do is un-tar the archive and move the .pm file to the right 
location.  This provides a cross-platform SNMP capability...I have 
a script working on NT that can be moved to Linux or Solaris and 
run without modification.

****************************************************************** 
Perl Corner

One or two readers have shown interest in Perl programming, so I 
thought that I would include a Perl Corner here for future Perl- 
Win32 programmers.  I will be posting short tutorials and exercises 
here...snippets of code that are written by myself and your 
wonderful readers!  Maybe by inviting contributions, we can all 
learn a little more.

The first thing you need to do is to get Perl.  You need ActivePerl, 
and the latest version is build 509.  Go to:

http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl/download.htm

and download the build.  The file name is 'APi509e.exe' and the 
file is about 4.6MB.  After you install it, on either 95, 98 or 
NT, make sure that the path to perl.exe is correct in your PATH 
statement.

For some basic tutorials, start by browsing around:

http://www.perl.com 
http://www.perl.org 
http://www.netaxs.com/~joc/perlwin32.html

Before we get into the particulars about the language, we'll do the 
obligatory 'Hello World' program.  Now, Perl programs end in the 
'.pl' extension...the easiest way to write your programs is to go 
to the Perl directory (usually c:\perl) and type:

c:\perl>notepad hello.pl

Now, in Notepad, type the following lines:

#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exe 
print "Hello, World!\n";

Now, save the file and type:

c:\perl>hello.pl

Tada!!  Your first program.  Now, to spruce it up a little, change 
the program to read:

#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exe 
$name = $ARGV[0]; 
print "Hello, $name!\n";

Now, type:

c:\perl>hello.pl myname

Okay, now let's add a little something extra...our last version of 
hello.pl took an argument, and displayed it in the text that was 
printed to the screen.  Now, let's set it up so that it will print 
either the argument, or a default, if no argument is given:

#! c:\perl\bin\perl.exe 
$name = shift || 'Capt. Picard'; 
print "Hello, $name!\n";

Now that we've done a couple of programs, let's look at the particular 
parts of the program.  The first line of your Perl scripts should 
start with the 'she-bang' line...this is a holdover from Unix, and 
identifies the interpreter to be used when executing the script. 
The '#!' is referred to as 'she-bang' and is followed by the path to 
the Perl interpreter...on Win95 or NT this will likely be c:\perl\ 
bin\perl.exe, if you installed Perl in the c:\perl directory.

The next line, in the last two scripts, got the arguments that were 
entered with the script.  In the first case, we used $ARGV[0], and 
in the second case, we used 'shift'.  In the second script, we 
used the line:

$name = shift || 'Capt. Picard';

which tells the interpreter, "Get the first argument and assign it 
to scalar (variable) '$name', but if there aren't any arguments, 
assign 'Capt. Picard' to $name."

Finally, we send the text to 'standard output' (ie, STDOUT, or the 
screen) using the print statement.

Okay, more next time!  User contributions are appreciated...please 
comment the code (comments are lines that begin with just a '#'), 
and your contribution will be copyrighted to you.  Next time, 
we'll look at getting some Windows-specific information from your 
own computer.  Before too long, we'll be writing sockets...  ;-)
