"Introducing... the RJ!!!!!!"

 This is Fearless Leader Carolyn Meinel here to give you the results of my 
Fearless Investigation of our candidate for the new Supreme Editor of the 
Happy Hacker list, Dr. R.J. Gosselin.

 It turns out that RJ is a super great guy, wonderful sense of humor, 
entrepreneur, gentle family man with seven (count them, seven) home-schooled 
children, and death on a keyboard to bad guy hackers. If you happen to own a 
bank, his doctoral dissertation will make your hair stand on end. It's a 
good thing RJ gets bored by the idea of becoming an expatriate billionaire.

 I got help from Winn Schwartau, who is the head of the US Cybermanhatten 
project to battle information warfare, to find out just how good RJ's 
recently completed doctoral dissertation is. Answer -- eeek!!!!

 RJ also has a dynamic and humorous writing style. You'll get a blast, and 
maybe a wakeup call, from his Guide to Social Engineering in this Digest. We 
look forward to your Guides becoming classics on the hacker scene, RJ!

"Well, Here We Go"

 Hi there, everyone; Carolyn asked me to take a few minutes to introduce 
myself to the list. I'm also going to identify for you how the "upper 
echelons" of the Happy Hacker list have been re-organized now that COFL's 
(that's "Carolyn, Our Fearless Leader") has a schedule that precludes her 
from the day to day activities of HH list management. Then, later on in 
this digest, you'll find the first part of a feature article entitled 
"Guide To Social Engineering".

 There are several things you learn having seven kids (20,19,18,9,7,5 and 
2.5 -- Yeah, I know, we had to take a break in the middle).  You learn to 
manage time really, really well.  You learn that what originally seems to 
be an insignificant detail can be very important.  You learn how to 
communicate very, very clearly.  You learn how to pull out your hair. You 
learn how to say "No" 2,456 times in a row. And you also learn how to 
understand "creative logic".  (Newbie Note: Four out of five of the above 
skills help with hacking.) 
(Second Newbie Note:  Pay attention to detail!  {It will make or break you 
as a hacker} Go back to the previous paragraph and count again - there are 
six things mentioned, although only four of them will help you develop your 
skills.)

 Anyway, now for the obligatory boring bio details.  I spent from '76 to 
'79 in the U.S. Marines, assigned to Military Intelligence as an "S-2 
Alpha" with a Hawiian Marine Battalion. While doing that, I traveled to 
Okinowa, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan and Taiwan.  (Never got to visit 
Australia, but promise to jump at any invitation.)  I got involved in PC's 
just before DOS 3.0 made it's great debut, and have been addicted ever 
since.  I have just earned my Ph.D., after working on it for only 
seventy-two centuries (well, it seemed that long!!) and I run a small 
network technology based in North Carolina.  Aside from being the Editor of 
this list, I am actively developing security consulting jobs.  I have been 
working in the martial arts since age 12, and hold a Fifth Degree Balck 
Belt in Shizuka Do, and a Third Degree Black Belt in Isshin-Ryu. (Refer to 
"gentle family man" statement, paragraph 2.) I am an expert with a pistol 
(according to the USMC, anyway), not too bad with a rifle, and deadly with 
a pager.  However, my "weapon of choice" is my keyboard and a phone line. 
;-) OK, enough punishment.  Anybody who wants to know more can download my 
bio from www.pentagon.gov/secret.agents/US.  One of my goals is to travel 
to the Middle East, and I am especially interested in Northern Africa.

Moderators Listing -- FYI

 Let me move on, I'd like to describe how your digest questions are being 
handled.  Questions sent to the HH list get routed by me to one of several 
volunteer moderators.  These folks, and the areas of questions they handle, 
are:

Carolyn Meinel Linux, Unix 
Coyote   newbie-intermediate general 
Mel Gray      newbie-net 
Rodger Prata  newbie-windows 
Jopee Llosa   newbie-windows 
Karl Schaffarczyk Mac 
Strider   Mac

 These individuals come up with the answers to your questions, and then 
forward the info back to me.  I compile the digests and send them out. 
Articles of general interest can be submitted to me at any time.  I will 
review them and post the best ones in an appropriate digest; immediately 
making you world famous for 27.3 minutes. (Possibly more, possibly less.) 
So keep those questions and comments coming.  If you're getting this 
Digest, you know the addresses.

 Also, if you think you've got what it takes to be a moderator -- send me 
an email and tell me what area you think you can handle ---- and WHY.  Give 
me background and details.  You may just have what it takes.  Like the USMC 
- We're looking for a few good "men"; but it's a tougher job than you 
think.  Somewhat akin to drinking water from a firehose!

 But -- please note -- this list is for legal hacking !!  Please do not 
forward indictable confessions and expect to have me post them in upcoming 
digests.  Furthermore, since you never know who may be monitoring my mail - 
you may find yourself with several well-armed Federal visitors offering 
extended government-sponsored vacation packages if you do.  Let's confine 
comments and questions to areas that will enhance skills, security and 
general individual responsibility.  As most of you know, several law 
enforcement agents subscribe to this list, you don't want to go bucking for 
more than your 27.3 minutes of fame.  Just ask Mitnick.

*New GTmHH Coming In 1 Week

 Be on the lookout!  Carolyn's next Guide To (mostly) Harmless Hacking is 
in for review, and will be sent out within a week or so.  You're going to 
love it!  It will make "hero's" out of many of you. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
*NEXT ISSUE:

RJ will include part 1 of his Guide To Social Engineering.  You also be 
able to download the entire 
Text of his dissertation from a certain well-known security site.  More 
details next week.

Does anyone know how to find someone's dynamic IP address if you know 
that they are connected to the internet at that time using just their

 Hiding IP Addresses...

Subject: [HH] hiding IP address in IRC

Hi all, please excuse the lamer's question but is there a way to hide 
your IP address in IRC so that other users won't know what ISP I'm using

========================= 
*NIX Passwd File Intro... 
=========================

From: Krewz <evile@hotmail.com>

The passwd file is a series of lines, each with user info on it, 
the first section of the line (root in this case) is the user login 
name.  The second part (x) is where the encoded password goes but in 
this case the x means that the file is shadowed.  The third part(1) is 
the user number and the fourth part (Super-User) is the user's name. 
The final part is the user's home directory.  You may be having trouble 
cracking this because this is a shadowed file.  The x represents the 
place where the password would normally go.  You have to locate the 
unshadowed copy of the file in order to crack it.

/etc/passwd is set out like this:

username:encrypted password:userid:groupid:other info:home 
directory:shell

it appears that the file you have acquired is shadowed, so it is of 
little use to you. You need the shadow file (on some systems 
/etc/shadow).  This contains the encrypted password data, instead of an 
x in the password field of the passwd file.

If you don't want to spend some cash with a router, you can set up a 
Workstation  (or server) to act like a router, and that can be done with 
NT, Linux, 
Or even Netware...

Hi again. Couple of answers:

Re: Shell Scripting tutorials 
============================= 
clOut, you might find these useful:

Using csh (bourne) at: 
http://www.ocean.odu.edu/ug/shell_help.html

I use them for reference. Can't recall which is best, but you can find 
loads of tutorials kicking about the net. The thing you have to remember

(and you probly know this already) is that the first line tells the 
server what shell to use, and all shells have slightly different syntax and 
commands. If you want to use any examples you find on the net, check the 
first line to make sure it's the same as the shell and dir you're going 
to use.

Re: FTP-Logins file 
=================== 
Well, Matthias, that's a Unix passwd file :-) 
Format is, roughly, from memory: 
username 
crypt-encrypted password 
user id number (uid) 
group id I think (gid) 
path of home dir 
shell?

all separated by colons (:).

Check on the net for docs, there's plenty. The crypt-encrypted password 
Is obviously the interesting bit. There is a prog called htpasswd on my 
server, in <htdocs_root>/support which generates encrypted words and 
pops them into a text file for your perusal. I have no idea how crypting 
works, but I have heard of progs that crack the resulting encrypted words. 
Through playing about I noticed that htpasswd generates different results from 
The same words, so it's probably seeded with the system time or something. I 
dunno.

Woof, this is getting a little long. Sorry about that.

Catch you later.

Hi there,

Thanx for a great service, you guys are the best. 
I hope that you can help me, 
I work for quite a large firm in there IT division, 
and up until now have had absolutely no restrictions 
on the use of internet access, but recently they 
installed a firewall, called "gauntlet" I'm not sure 
which version, but they are going to restrict our access 
to evenings and early morning. All I really want to do 
is get into FTP sites and Gopher sites. I am running win

  More Win95 Answers... 
=========================

From: numius@globalmail.net 
Subject: RE: HH Win95 mini-net

Jose M Garcia <tost@juno.com> inquired about dial-up networking help 
Under Win95, using the RAS included in MSPlus! package. 
OK, d00d3,  (como no hables ingles. vaya chasco) the answer is in basics 
The following: 
Assuming that the Remote Access Server is well configured (i.e the IPX,, 
TCP/IP and NETBEUI are present in the system, as well as Filesharing and 
The MS Net Client, all to be installed thru the Net Icon at the Control 
Panel) and that the directory you want to became to public access has the 
share 
option set to on with its password established, if your system answer a 
phone call and on the client computer a form to insert the password is 
shown, everything is in order.

This however, is quite a common thing that though the two machines are 
connected, the client cannot see anything from the server machine and if 
you try the option Network at the desktop, the system replies a non access 
error.

The reason for this is that Win95 RAS is not considered by Microsoft as 
A real network, which only applies to netcards. So, to access the server 
File system (and even to run programs from the server BUT NOT ON THE SERVER) 
The client must use the Explorer window, click on the icon that represents 
"connection to a network unit" and (very important) on the form that 
will be shown to you the path must be written as \\SERVER\C , where SERVER is 
the name given to the host computer (Control Panel -> Net Icon -> Ident) and 
C is the name given to the shared directory or unit (C is the default to 
Share your whole HD, do you dare?). Thats all to connect to computers under 
Win95, as once done all this, the client will see another unit added to is 
Explorer tree which is the shared Host directory. You can also follow this to 
Share printers.

  More Linux Answers... 
=========================

please withold my email address 
 

Well finally some *NIX posts!! OK ive got a few answers for some of the 
Question s.

First: to the person with minilinux...scrap it, get a real distro.

Second to the passwd file hacker:

If your file looks like what you gave example of:

root:x:0:1:Super-User:/:/bin/true 
ftp:x:500:2:Anon Ftp:/ftp:/bin/true

thats no good.  Its shadowed.  The second field (where you see the x) is 
normally where the encoded (not encrypted) password goes.  Try looking for a 
file called /etc/shadow .  That file contains the encoded password minus 
some of 
the stuff  in the first file.  Im sure you could write a handy shell script to 
create the proper file you would need to run through a cracker such as cracker 
jack, ucf john, and the likes.  There is also a program called Crack that 
sysadmins 
use to check for weak passwords that does a good job.  That should get you 
going 
in theright direction.  If you program check out the crypt() routine as thats 
what most *NIX uses to encode their passwords.

and for the shell scripting guy Clout,

the bash man page is an excellent place to begin (if your using bash 
that is) or  actually the man page for any shell.  There are also books 
available 
for the common shells (ie bash, C, bourne, korne) but those cost money :)

minilinux...scrap it, get a real distro.

Second to the passwd file hacker:

If your file looks like what you gave example of:

root:x:0:1:Super-User:/:/bin/true

A Note From The SUPREME Moderator: 
==================================

A quick question concerning all who post to this list: 
You (the moderator) make a point of saying not to post anything we 
wouldn't send to our friendly neighborhood narc.  What exactly would you do 
if a 
certain law enforcement agency came to you to investigate someone who 
posted to the GTMHH.  Would you give them the information they wanted 
 ~*~ if you did not have to?~*~ 
Or would you side with the hacker community and deny 
Them what they asked for?

[Carolyn: Since we don't allow Digest posts that incriminate people, we 
have no testimony to give on poster to the authorities. We destroy those rare 
incoming posts that contain incriminating information, but can only pray 
that the authorities will not someday burst in with a search warrant and 
recover those erased files. 
DON'T SEND US ANYTHING YOU WOULDN'T SEND A NARC, 
and I mean it! The reason we shut down the Happy Hacker unmoderated 
discussion list is that a certain self-destructive person announced his 
intention to publicly commit a US federal hacking felony, and invited 
others to join. Sheesh. On the other hand, several times hackers have 
retaliated against the Happy Hacker list by vandalizing the Internet Service 
Providers who were serving us. These are cases in which I am delighted to 
cooperate with the FBI. The other exception is the time someone offered me 
money 
to commit a telecommunications crime. People like that are not hackers but 
mere gangsters and deserve nothing but hard time in prison with a cell mate 
named "Spike."]

SORRY IF YOU RECIEVE MULTIPLE COPIES OF THIS MESSAGE ... 
WE EXPERIENCED SERVER PROBLEMS DURING TRANSMISSION 
AND RE-SENT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE GOT AT LEAST ONE. 
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Sometimes people make poor choices; and sometimes they require us to make 
clear distinctions.  This is the case with the "Happy Hacker Chat List" run 
by Jesse Brown.

        We apologize in particular for the way that list was used last 
Saturday to assault Bronc Buster in a classic hacker war combination of 
breaking into and trashing the ISP he used, setting up a fake Web site, 
setting his finger files so they could not be altered or deleted without the 
program *chattr* being run from root, then deleting the chattr program... and 
then inviting people on that chat list to attack him for the contents  of 
that finger file and web site. And making out like the fact that it took a 
few days to fix the problem was proof Bronc wanted it there.

 Carolyn and I have made repeated efforts to negotiate Jesse's association 
of this list with us.  Unfortunately, we have failed. This is sad because 
Jesse is such a genius with TCP/IP. We had hoped to include him as a 
moderator for that area.  For a period of time, he was even hosting our 
moderator site and the Happy hacker list, for which we thank him for  his 
hard work.

 So now the Happy Hacker organization has to disassociate ourselves  from 
Jesse Brown, his "Happy Hacker Chat List," and any input as moderator.  The 
messages on his list have become vulgar, encourage credit card fraud, and 
violate our approach to learning.  They are delving into that "dark side" of 
the hacker scene; while we are committed to a "white hat" approach to system 
security.  Because of these clear differences, Carolyn and I feel we should 
make a formal warning and apology to the list. Warning regarding  Jesse's 
list's content, flames, and encouragement of law breaking.  Apology 
regarding the misconceptions that it may create.

 For the record, neither Carolyn nor I have attempted to "censor" his list, his running 
of his list, or his management of his list -- because it is simply that *his list*.  We have 
asked him not to take advantage of *our* list of names, and not to use the name 
"Happy Hacker".  We have sent several emails in an attempt to resolve the issues. 
We are currently attempting to advise his parents of his actions, since he is delving 
into activities that could have serious repercussions.

 No one can stop Jesse from calling his list a "Happy" anything.  Even 
though he has been asked to re-name it, he does not appear to be willing to 
comply.  Since he has a copy of the HH mailing list, it is entirely possible 
the you will receive mail from him.  Carolyn and I would ask all of you to adopt a 
professional approach; flame wars never solved anything.  Neither would 
6,000 plus readers mailing Jesse asking him to stop or rename whatever he's doing. 
So, please be polite to him and remember the good that he has done for Happy Hacker.

*Psst.. hey kid -- Wanna Free Password ???

Alternate Title:  Cyber Child Abuse !

 As we all know, there are plenty of unscrupulous people out there who think nothing of using someone else to cover the tracks of their crime.  Sad, but true.  This is a warning that is intended to protect our readers against just such a problem.

 Recently, several unprincipled hackers have been providing "newbie's" with logon names and passwords to ISP's. They then encourage them to take advantage of their new-found power and hack away. UNFORTUNATE PROBLEM #1 - Most of the people they are providing this information to are either a) Kids, b) too new to know how to spoof their IP address and evade identification, or c) both.  UNFORTUNATE PROBLEM #2 - According to COFL, these kids are getting nailed in droves.

 What is frequently behind such "evasive tactics" is covering more deliberate and sinister activities on a particular server with a hail of overt traffic and hacking attempts.  In other words, keep the sysadmins so busy dealing with the *obvious* hacking problem that they have no time to look for and track the hidden one.

 This approach ranks right up there with using innocent civilians as a bullet shield or sending kids walking thru minefields to clear them.  The folks who take this approach are all class....low. :-(        Be smart, kids -- don't take passwords from strangers.

While I cannot go into details about where, when, why, etc - I would be very interested in being informed of ISP's that get shut down with serious disk problems.  The combined information from multiple sources would help with the investigation.  (Just include "ISP CRASH REPORT" in the message line.  Thanks.)

 *Apology Reprint & Responses

Last week we sent out an apology to all of the readers of the list.  Due to server problems at one of our ISP's (hmmm .... I wonder if there's any relation to the above item ?????) several folks got nothing more than the subject of the message.  Don't touch that dial1 there is nothing wrong with *your* set.

For the benefit of anyone who requested and did not recieve a resend of the apology message:  It is reprinted here.  It is followed by some of the responses I received.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE:

Sometimes people make poor choices; and sometimes they require us to make 
clear distinctions.  This is the case with the "Happy Hacker Chat List" run 
by Jesse Brown.

        We apologize in particular for the way that list was used last 
Saturday to assault Bronc Buster in a classic hacker war combination of 
breaking into and trashing the ISP he used, setting up a fake Web site, 
setting his finger files so they could not be altered or deleted without the 
program *chattr* being run from root, then deleting the chattr program... and 
then inviting people on that chat list to attack him for the contents  of 
that finger file and web site. And making out like the fact that it took a 
few days to fix the problem was proof Bronc wanted it there.

 Carolyn and I have made repeated efforts to negotiate Jesse's association 
of this list with us.  Unfortunately, we have failed. This is sad because 
Jesse is such a genius with TCP/IP. We had hoped to include him as a 
moderator for that area.  For a period of time, he was even hosting our 
moderator site and the Happy hacker list, for which we thank him for  his 
hard work.

 So now the Happy Hacker organization has to disassociate ourselves  from 
Jesse Brown, his "Happy Hacker Chat List," and any input as moderator.  The 
messages on his list have become vulgar, encourage credit card fraud, and 
violate our approach to learning.  They are delving into that "dark side" of 
the hacker scene; while we are committed to a "white hat" approach to system 
security.  Because of these clear differences, Carolyn and I feel we should 
make a formal warning and apology to the list. Warning regarding  Jesse's 
list's content, flames, and encouragement of law breaking.  Apology 
regarding the misconceptions that it may create.

 For the record, neither Carolyn nor I have attempted to "censor" his list, his running 
of his list, or his management of his list -- because it is simply that *his list*.  We have 
asked him not to take advantage of *our* list of names, and not to use the name 
"Happy Hacker".  We have sent several emails in an attempt to resolve the issues. 
We are currently attempting to advise his parents of his actions, since he is delving 
into activities that could have serious repercussions.

 No one can stop Jesse from calling his list a "Happy" anything.  Even 
though he has been asked to re-name it, he does not appear to be willing to 
comply.  Since he has a copy of the HH mailing list, it is entirely possible 
the you will receive mail from him.  Carolyn and I would ask all of you to adopt a 
professional approach; flame wars never solved anything.  Neither would 
6,000 plus readers mailing Jesse asking him to stop or rename whatever he's doing. 
So, please be polite to him and remember the good that he has done for Happy Hacker.

Now, here are some of the responses -------

***    I'd just like to write to tell you what a wonderful service you are 
doing for the hacker community. In the midst of all the muck, and hype 
surronding hacking, I think you guys really shine through.

***        I agree totaly that people should not be encouraged to use hacking as a bad 
thing. However as one who loves to play with unix holes and security risks 
on my own home computer i find that most of any kind of hacking is an 
annoance.  Like a simple line in WIN95 config.sys DOS=SINGLE sets Windows95 
into a confusing mess.  But the bad hacking like emailing the password 
file, and ftping off vmlinuz has no use in these lists, mailings and so forth.

**** WHOA!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hold on a minute here!!!!  Yes, it might be somewhat vulgar 
in a few posts, but that is free speech.  Although I don't feel it's a good 
idea to cuss at anyone, I'm not going to stop others.  That is a personal 
choice.

ENCOURAGE credit card fraud?!?!  Not at all.  I remember one single little 
post asking about a credit card reader, you had a hissy fit, then refused to 
back down even when numerous people told you perfectly legal applications for 
it.  Although I learned a great deal from you, if this is against your 
approach to learning, I don't want to be anywhere near it. 
 Editor's Note:  "Numerous" = 2 in this case. ;-)

**** I have been reading the list for a while now on the understanding this 
was a list for people who wanted to stay legal and share information.   I 
think the attack on Bronc Buster was utterly disgusting, not in the 
spirit of the list and definately not in the spirit of hacking.

I would like to congratulate carolyn on the action she took and I hope 
she would do exactly the same thing in future.  I am against a censored 
list but when things like this happen I see the need to keep some control.

**** IN REPLY TO THE ABOVE MESSAGE - WE ALSO GOT THESE --

****  I'm against people using this list to suck up to the moderator... 
No matter how you slice it, its still SPAM. 
Editor's Note:  What's really funny here is that Carolyn isn't the moderator.

****   ARE YOU STUPID OR SOMETHING? That's basically all I have to saw. 
Carolyn was trying to censor the list  - there was no doubt about that 
so my question is to you: how could you beleive that Carolyn did the right thing and be 
against censorship at the same time?

**** To be honest with you, the first I heard about this was the latest issue of HH and the copy of the above e-mail.  I really don't know all the story, so I'll reserve judgement until I get the facts straight.  On a moral principle, I agree with you about the issue of censorship, but if the letter is a privately ran operation, then I suppose Carolyn can do whatever she wants.  She will just lose a lot of subscribers in the process though, and that's a shame.  I've found the information in the letters very informative, and have learned more about how my computer system works from the newsletter than all my college computer classes combined.  It'd be sad to lose such a great source of information over something like this.  Still, I can't support the attack on Bronc Buster 
either.  This list is out there with your and my names on it, and I really don't want a bunch of undue attention from the FBI, NSA, or other people in law enforcement, especially for something I had no part in, or even knowledge of.  I'm sure you probably feel the same way; who wants to get busted for something you didn't even do?  So if Carolyn feels she needs to disassociate herself from this, so be it.  In that sense, I don't blame her.  The list can go on without her involvement, if there is enough interest by others.  Personally, I don't want to be involved in it either, if it means risking going to jail for someone else's choices.  Doesn't mean I want to take away their right to choose or speak; just that MY right to choose otherwise should be respected as well.  No flames intended; just my humble opinion.  Feel free to comment and pass it on, if you wish.

OK - so now you get the idea of how things went.

* "Guide to Social Engineering" - Update

 I have received several emails requesting information on how to get copies of my dissertation.  Winn Schwartau will be making it available on his web site in the "Bookstore" section.  I am finishing up some modifications to the document before he posts it, since I am severely alergic to jail, and don't want to compromise the security of anyone who was/wasn't/might have been referred to in the original document.

 The URL to check is www.infowar.com.  It will be in the bookstore section, and you should be able to download the document beginning on Monday. Don't let the first couple chapters bore you too badly.  But most of the interesting-type stuff can be found from Chapter Three and forward.

 Once we have a finalized and sanitized-so-I-don't-go-to-jail version, I'll also be including some excerpts in upcoming digests.  Hope you understand the delay.  ;-)
