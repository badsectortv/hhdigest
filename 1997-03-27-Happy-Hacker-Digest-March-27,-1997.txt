In Defense of GALF

So should I organize a SADASAD team? (Seek And Destroy All Seek And Destroy)

Why not store on NON-NETWORKED computers? Seems like you are overly paranoid 
about this.

>You may contact us by mail at 1705 14th St. suite 354 Boulder CO 80302

Mind if I drop by?

>Please include a phone number so we can contact you back.

Seems like you would provide a "throw-away" email account for contact, 
or a phone number, or something besides snail-mail. Hell, I only 
send books via snail mail.

Do you really think a group like that would base their operations from an 
account like that? Catch a clue before you fight back.

What makes you think you can take them? Carolyn and her elite uber-hacker 
friends at UTEP haven't been able to. Her good friend super-cop Ira Winkler 
hasn't caught them. But you will?

"Snatch back your brain". D00d. Don't believe Carolyn's quasi-media hype. 
She has no clue about everything GALF has done. I would guess I know maybe a 
slight fragment, but I know it is more than she knows. GALF is not this big 
bad evil hacker gang like she makes them out to be. Quit believing her rants.

Carolyn: We haven't tried to take out GALF because it's silly. Suppose we 
knew of a computer that was actually theirs and not just belonging to some 
hapless ISP they've hacked. Suppose we break in and rm the system philes and 
lock them out so they have to use a boot disk and reinstall, and in the 
meantime reply to everyone who emails them saying "Whoopie doopie, we've 
rooted GALF!!!*&%@##!!!" Ahem, seems a little childish. Sheesh, besides, 
jericho's so afraid of my hacker team he won't even allow us an account on 
his box to demonstrate to him how easily we could get root from a user account.

GALF Discussion List Launched 
========================================================

>From the X-men <antigalf@emarket.com>

New ANTI GALF Mailing list.  Moderated by me, the X-men (all of 'em).

Please send a message with the subject SUBSCRIBE, and in the body your EMAIL 
ADDRESS, and NOTHING ELSE.  You will then be subscribed.  Send this to:

ANTIGALF@EMARKT.COM

You an also send your comments on GALF to there.  I would like GALF 
themselves to contribute to this list themselves, and explain themselves..

I suggest that all messages are sent via one of the many fake mail programs 
around, because GALF could get their dirty mitts on the messages, but I 
certainly won't be giving anything away.

Okay, here is a very very simple kluge to temporarily fix it.  Create a 
file /var/tmp/dead.letter with chmod 0644 perms.  That way no one can make 
the hard link to /etc/passwd, b/c the file /var/tmp/dead.letter already 
exists.

This is why Good Little Sysadmins(tm) have /, /var, /tmp, /usr, etc. on 
separate partitions and/or drives.

If /etc and /var/tmp are on different partitions this wont work. Can't 
symlink cross-device far as I know.

Cracking Question 
===============================================

(please make anonymous)

OK, lets say I have gained access to a UNIX system (ULTRIX V4.3 (Rev. 
44)) and then unshadowed the passwd file and gotten lots of passwords. 
Now, when I login as one of these people and do nothing harmful (just 
look around) and then logout, the next time so and so logs it is will 
say "last login from "hacker IP address". 
How can I prevent this from happening? In other words, I am not that 
worried about sysadm logs, cause I am doing nothing bad to the system 
(doing nothing at all really), but I don't want so and so whose account I 
used to complain that someone is using his/her account.

Thanks

Hacking in Holland 
==========================================================

Hacking In Progress is an open-air hacker convention on a 
campsite near Almere in the Netherlands. Visitors will bring 
their own computer equipment and tents to build the largest 
non-military open-air Ethernet ever. People from all over 
the Netherlands and other countries will come together to 
learn and discuss the benefits and the risks of new 
technologies. They'll listen to lectures, participate in 
workshops, enjoy special presentations and - last but not 
least - party. All of this in the friendly open-air 
environment of a very wired campsite far away from the 
civilized world.

HIP will be a place for hackers, artists, activists and 
many, many others to network themselves, both in the social 
and electronic sense of the word. HIP will deal with the 
social and political aspects of information technology, 
security, Internet, access to technology, cryptography, and 
concerns about spamming and other 'hacker-related' topics.

Who is organizing HIP? 
----------------------

Once there was a little magazine in The Netherlands called 
`Hack-Tic', and it published wild ways to play tricks on the 
information infrastructure of the world. The magazine 
doesn't exist anymore, but most of the people that wrote 
articles for the magazine or helped organize Hacking at the 
End of the Universe (1993) and even some of the people that 
helped put up the Galactic Hacker Party (1989) are still in 
touch with each other. The every-four-year-itch has gotten 
to us again...

Open-air? 
---------

There'll be no hotel rooms or anything like that so you'll 
want to bring at least a tent and a sleeping bag to HIP, 
even if this means you can't bring the paper-tape unit that 
came with your VAX 11/780. We'll supply a campground, 
toilets, showers, good food and electrical power (as close 
to 220V/50Hz as possible) and we'll do our best to supply 
everyone who wants it with an Ethernet connection. You will 
probably be able to trade wiring, extra outlets, Ethernet 
cards, and the use of modular crimping tools for almost 
anything.

What will be the issues at HIP? 
-------------------------------

A lot can and will happen in the coming months, and we'll 
keep adding new topics even during the event itself. But 
we're definitely going to discuss the legal situation 
regarding encryption, as well as the latest technical 
developments in this field. The current decay of the Usenet, 
copyright issues, censorship as well as many other 
legislative, social political and technical issues 
surrounding Internet will be discussed. Computer security, 
or the lack thereof will also be a hot topic. We'll have 
research workshops (i.e. GSM and chipcard security) and you 
can also join many `how-to' workshops and lectures where you 
can pick up on Linux (Unix you can run at home, not built by 
Microsoft), perl (a very powerful computer language) and 
many, many other topics.

Just visit our web site at http://www.hip97.nl/ and use the 
form to subscribe to the announcement mailing list. It's 
spam-free and will only carry HIP announcements written by 
us. You can also participate in the ongoing, yet slightly 
messy debate in the newsgroup alt.hacking.in.progress

If you don't have access to the web you can subscribe to the 
announcement mailing list by sending an email message to

with the line subscribe hip-announce in the body of the message.

Announcements will also be posted in alt.hacking.in.progress

No. Carolyn does not know what Social Engineering is. I recently spoke with 
someone on IRC who claims to have prank called her, only to find she thought 
he was trying to social engineer her. prank != SEing.

Carolyn: Hmmm, more evidence of atrophied sense of humor... That guy jericho 
communicated with sure got mad when I told him he didn't know the first 
thing about social engineering, he, he.... Sorry, d00dz, I'm going to win. I 
am the biggest propeller head on the Net. Yes! Yes! YES!!!

Changing Netscape, IE Logos 
==================================================

From: Wendy Mosiman <wmosiman@feist.com>

Hey... I thought it would be totally K-Rad 31337 (of course I'm new to 
this stuff and my opinion doesn't count for much) if you could change 
the pointer in Netscape, you know the little hand with the pointer 
finger up that points to links, into something else.  Such as maybe the 
middle finger up.  :)  This kind of crude hacking appeals to me for some 
reason.  If anyone has any ideas on how to do this e-mail me if you 
would.  thanks in advance

There is No Escape.

-------------------------------------------------- 
From: "Michael Paul" <mbp@locke.ccil.org>

I don't know about changing the logo in Netscape, but in IE it's easy. 
First you need the picture to put there:  a 40x40 animated bitmap.  To make 
one, just make a really tall bitmap in Paint and paste each frame directly 
under the preceding one.  The first frame will be shown when nothing is 
being loaded, the next three are shown once when a download starts, and the 
rest are played in a loop until the download is done.

Once you have the bitmap, run Registry Editor (REGEDIT.EXE), open the 
subkey "HKEY_CUURNT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Toolbar" and 
change "BrandBitmap" to the name of the bitmap.

When the text labels on the toolbar are turned off, a smaller image is 
used.  Its dimensions are 23x23, and is specified by "SmBrandBitmap".

>So if somebody figures how to do it please post it on this list.

For IE 3.0 (and I would assume 2.0 as well), use a text editor to create a 
REG file, and add this text:

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Toolbar] 
"BrandBitmap"="whatever.bmp"

Where whatever.bmp is the path and name of the image you wish to replace 
the stock animation with.

A few things to note:  IE will use the width of your image file as the 
height for each individual frame.  (ie. a 40 x 160 pixel bitmap would have 
4 frames)  Also, you need to have an even number of frames in your bitmap, 
or else the animation doesn't work quite right.  The first frame at the top 
of the file is the frame IE sits on when it's not animated, when you are 
not loading or contacting anything.

To get rid of your customized animated logo, just go into RegEdit and 
delete the "BrandBitmap" key. 
 

Hope this helps, you can email me if ya want and I'll send an example image.
