 *** NT Local GetAdmin Exploit 
================================================================== 
From: MJE <mark@NTSHOP.NET>

July 27, 1998, (NTSD) - Three gentlemen from India have been kind enough to 
reveal to The NT Shop (http://www.ntshop.net or http://www.ntsecurity.net) a 
serious hole in Windows NT systems (any version of Workstation or Server) 
that readily grants the user complete membership to the Administrators group.

According to the discovers, this exploit works against all versions of 
WinNT, including WinNT 5.0 betas, and may also be possible against a domain 
controllers in certain circumstances -- this is yet unconfirmed and 
un-demonstrated as far as I know. Their sample program, SECHOLE.EXE, only 
exploits the *LOCAL* user database.

THE EXPLOIT, IN A NUTSHELL: by using existing Windows NT services, an 
application can locate a certain API call in memory, modify the instructions 
in a running instance, and gain debug-level access to the system, where it 
then grants the currently logged-in user complete membership to the 
Administrators group in the local user database.

The NT Shop has reported this problem to Microsoft -- we've been in close 
contact with their security folks since last week, and are told a fix is 
ready -- I suspect they'll release a bulletin in the next 24 hours.

For more information on the problem, as well as a brief interview with the 
discovers and a working copy of the program demonstrating this serious 
problem, visit our Web site where you'll find the page link at the top of 
the list in the left window frame.

 *** NT registry default settings recovery 
=================================================================== 
From: "Dennis Hettema" <movingtheworld@hotmail.com>

Hi all,

The following is not really hacking or stuph but it is a bit of an 
alca-selzer for registry probs with an NT server.

One of the things I really like to do is play around with the registry, 
but if your doing this too much you might (almost certainly will) get all 
kinds of error message's and in other words you went a step to far.

Usually you'll have backups of the registry before you start messing 
around in it, but if you sort of forgot to do this, try the following:

On the NT server in the 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters 
key remove all the values except:

- EnableSharedNetDrivers 
- LMAnnounce 
- NULLSessionsPipes 
- NULLSessionsShares 
- Size

When you restart NT it will automatically reconfigure all the server 
stuff and optimize it with Microsoft's parameters.

[Dale - This key affects the Server service. If you mess with other keys 
you had better have a backup of your Registry...]

No.  There are 100 numbers it could be.  You have counted 01 through 99. 
You have forgotten poor little 00.  00 counts too. 
I hope you're not one of those people who think the next millenium begins

 *** How to fix ICQ trojan horse 
================================================================== 
From: Shaka <edouglas@bonwell.com>

Useful info for subscribers of the Happy Hackers Digest and ICQ users 
especially:

The ICQ trojan horse (the one I have is called ICQ_SRV) adds itself as a key 
into 
your registry. I ran a virus scanner which did not detect it, but found out how 
toget rid of it. To check if you have it and/or fix it, do the following:

Open REGEDIT. 
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. 
Go to SOFTWARE. 
Go to MICROSOFT. 
Go to Windows. 
Go to Current Version.

In the RunServices "folder", there will be a key called "Explorer". This key 
should NOT normally be there! If you find it, note the folder, and if it is an 
ICQ\Received Files folder ESPECIALLY, delete the key and restart.

Your computer should function normally, and you have defeated the trojan horse.

Feel free to email me if this is somehow incorrect.

 *** Start Button and Recycle Bin 
================================================================== 
From: "..." <erlank@intekom.co.za>

Hey there man!

First of all, I'd just like to tell the ppl out there how to change 
their Recycle Bin, using their Registry (and yes, I do make backups of 
my files, :) ) To change the text label, just search for the text string 
"Recycle Bin" in regedit and change it. Then to change the default, 
empty and full icons for the bin, click on the Recycle Bin's Default 
icon key. Then change the icon in that setting. At the moment, its 
shell32, 31 (that 31 is the number icon in the shell file). I changed 
the 31 to 41, which is a tree!

OK then, I already know how to change the text on the Start Button in 
explorer.exe, but I would just like to know if there is a way in the 
registry or in the explorer.exe file to remove or make invisible the 
Start Button ??

Thanks for running a brilliant digest!! 
cheers

 *** Visual DialogScript 
================================================================== 
From: joby07@juno.com

I want to tell you of this excellent programming language a friend found. 
It is called Visual DialogScript. It is like Visual Basic but it fits 
on one disk!!!

I dont know the URL for this program, but the company's name is JM Technical. 
I found this program excellent and entertaining.

[Dale: The url is http://www.vds.sade.net/index.htm]

You don't need programming experience although a little bit of BASIC would help.

The help feature is excellent with tutorials and tons of sample code. 
There is a 16-bit and 32-bit version. I have the registration code, if anyone 
would like it please email me.

I have written 2 programs already!! Without any teachers help; and a friend 
wrote a program that will check ur Juno mail automatically!!

Although, there is one minor problem. Whenver you compile 
your program, you MUST include a file called dsrun.exe (which 
can be found w/ the download) for the compiled file to run properly.

 *** Linux CD's for Cheap 
================================================================== 
From: mit6@Lehigh.EDU

A quick note for all who keep making excuses instead of getting Linux up and 
running... NO MORE EXCUSES! :)

If all that downloading has got ya in a quiver, check out 
http://www.linuxmall.com/ to get any of the popular releases you 
like, on a handy-dandy CD, for a whopping $1.49. And if you just can't decide 
which release you like, heck, order 6 of the most popular releases for 10 
bucks! If you are worried about doing some damage to your new 20 bazilion gig 
HD, check out the computer section at http://www.ebay.com/computers/ .

I just picked up a used 640 meg hard drive (plenty big for Linux) for 37 bucks. 
And finally, if you really want to go all out (like I had to), do not be 
afraid to 
spend the 45 dollars on "Linux Unleashed" by Sams Publishing. I had seen it 
mentioned in past Digests, and I can't begin to tell you how worthwhile it has 
been to pick up. If an 'eternal newbie' like myself can do it, I'm sure 
most of you can, and better than myself. Then, let the fun begin! (Legal fun, 
of course...:)

Keep on keepin' on 
-DJMT

P.S.- I've been getting the Digest almost since it started, and it is 
consistantly 
the most worthwhile piece of e-mail I read. Thanks for the great service!

 *** Empty the bin from Anywhere 
================================================================= 
From: Chin Yau <acmy1998@yahoo.com>

Ever wish to empty your Recycle Bin everywhere by just right-clicking 
on any icon? Cool huh? Here is the way to do it.

Start Windows Registry editor by running regedit.exe. Navigate down 
until we reach the location (which is the first on most machines) : 
  
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOTS\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers

Next, right-click the ContextMenuHandlers folder and choose New, 
Key. When the new folder appears, type the following:

{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}

Press Enter.

Note :- All "0" are the number 0 not the letter O.

After that, exit the Windows registry editor. Now when you right-click on 
any file, you will have the option to empty the recycle bin. 
================================================================= 
 *** Angelfire problem/exploit 
================================================================= 
From: "un none" <fr33ck3r@hotmail.com>

I am not sure if this exploit has already been discovered but I felt 
that this should be known. In anglefire after you log in you are taken 
to a screen where you can choose what page to edit, delete, ect...

Well, if you view the document source it tells the full login and password.

Now you say but how can I get this source.  Well contact the page owner 
using icq, aim, mirc, or email and tell them that there page might be 
hackable.  Tell them to give you that screens source code and you will 
tell them if it is vulnerable.  If you are trying to hack some elite 
hacking groups sight there is no chance this will work but I tried this 
on many people and only one knew the password was there (and all the 
people I tested it on claimed to be elite hackers), and all but two gave 
me the source.  Now if you have the source these are the lines you want to 
look for:  (Depending on there ad etc... the 
source is shorter or longer so it isn't on a specific line)

<input type="hidden" name="storage"  value="pa"> 
<input type="hidden" name="hpd"      value="hackersight"> 
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="elitepass">

The first line is the state they say they live in (note:its in the sight 
url) the second is the rest of the login and the third is the password.

 *** How to find and get rid rid of Back Orifice 
================================================================= 
From: James Strompolis <jimst@enteract.com>

Though not specific to NT security there has been much talk about Back Orifice 
lately.  I've played around with it a bit and here is a way to find it and get 
rid of it.

Default installation: 
Installs a 122k - 123k file called " .exe" in c:\windows\system with a modified 
date of 7/11/95.

Changes HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices\Default from 
blank to " .exe".

Transmits data on UDP Port 31337 - it's in the readme.

An attacker can modify these defaults to be anything they like but if you check 
the registry entries under

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices

and find one you are not familiar with (not the task scheduler, not a virus 
scanner, 
etc) that runs a 122k - 123k file (does not have to be an exe) from your 
c:\windows\system folder, it might be worth investigating further.  The file 
could probably be padded to be a different size or the code could be 
modified to 
mutate its size to help hide it.  There was some speculation in some of the 
media 
reports that a virus detection program might be able to detect the program 
in action. 
Network Associates McAfee Virus Scan did not set off any alarms.  Maybe 
another virus 
scanner will view the program's actions as suspicious?

Unless there are hidden "features" (still letting it run behind a firewall 
logging all traffic on the Back Orifice machine as a test to see if there is 
more to it) it is just a useful remote admin tool in a semi-GUI box that can be 
custom packaged to take advantage of existing Win9x security flaws.

Let me know if you've found more.

Cult of the Dead Cow Back Orifice Backdoor

Synopsis:

A hacker group known as the Cult of the Dead Cow has released a Windows 
95/98 backdoor named 'Back Orifice' (BO).  Once installed this backdoor 
allows unauthorized users to execute privileged operations on the affected 
machine. Back Orifice leaves evidence of its existence and can be detected and 
removed.  The communications protocol and encryption used by this backdoor 
has been broken by ISS X-Force.

Description:

A backdoor is a program that is designed to hide itself inside a target 
host in order to allow the installing user access to the system at a later 
time without using normal authorization or vulnerability exploitation.

Functionality:

The BO program is a backdoor designed for Windows 95/98. Once installed it 
allows anyone who knows the listening port number and BO password to 
remotely control the host.  Intruders access the BO server using either a 
text or graphics based client.  The server allows intruders to execute 
commands, list files, start silent services, share directories, upload and 
download files, manipulate the registry, kill processes, list processes, as 
well as other options.

Encrypted Communications:

All communications between backdoor client and the server use the User 
Datagram Protocol (UDP).  All data sent between the client and server is 
encrypted, however it is trivial to decrypt the data sent. X-Force has been 
able to decrypt BO client requests without knowing the password and use the 
gathered data to generate a password that will work on the BO server. 
The way that BO encrypts its packets is to generate a 2 byte hash from the 
password, and use the hash as the encryption key. The first 8 bytes of all 
client request packets use the same string: "*!*QWTY?", thus it is very 
easy to brute force the entire 64k key space of the password hash and 
compare the result to the expected string. Once you know the correct hash 
value that will decrypt packets, it is possible to start generating and 
hashing random passwords to find a password that will work on the BO 
server. In our tests in the X-Force lab, this entire process takes only a 
few seconds, at most, on a Pentium-133 machine. With our tools we have been 
able to capture a BO request packet, find a password that will work on the 
BO server, and get the BO server to send a dialog message to warn the 
administrator and kill its own process.

Determining if BO has been installed on your machine:

The BO server will do several things as it installs itself on a target host: 
* Install a copy of the BO server in the system directory 
(c:\windows\system) either as " .exe" or a user specified file name. 
* Create a registry key under 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices 
with the file name of the server file name and a description field of 
either "(Default)" or a user specified description. 
* The server will begin listening on UDP port 31337, or a UDP port 
specified by the installer.  You can configure RealSecure to monitor for 
network traffic on the default UDP 31337 port for possible warning signs.

In order to determine if you are vulnerable: 
1. Start the regedit program (c:\windows\regedit.exe). 
2. Access the key 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices. 
Look for any services that may not have been intentionally installed on the 
machine.  If the length of one of these file is close to 124,928 (give or 
take 30 bytes) then it is probably BO.

Recommended action:

BO can be removed by deleting the server and removing its registry entry. 
If possible, you should back up all user data, format your hard drive, and 
reinstall all operating systems and software on the infected machine. 
However, if someone has installed BO on your machine, then it is most likely 
part of a larger security breach.  You should react according to your site 
security policy.

Determining the password and configuration of an installed BO:

1. Using a text editor like notepad, view the server exe file. 
2. If the last line of the file is '8 8$8(8,8084888<8@8D8H8L8P8T8X8\8'8d8h8l8', 
then the server is using the default configuration.  Otherwise, the 
configuration will be the last several lines of this file, in this order: 
<filename><service description><port number><password> 
<optional plugin information>

Conclusion:

Back Orifice provides an easy method for intruders to install a backdoor on 
a compromised machine.  Back Orifice's authentication and encryption is 
weak, therefore an administrator can determine what activities and 
information is being sent via BO.  Back Orifice can be detected and 
removed.  This backdoor only works on Windows 95 and Windows 98 for now 
and not currently on Windows NT.

 *** In reply to the question about .au domains in whois servers 
================================================================== 
From: DungBeetle <dungbeetle4life@yahoo.com>

The whois servers for locations around the globe are:

American Registry for Internet Numbers - whois.arin.net 
Server for European locations: whois.ripe.net 
Server for Asia Pacific locations: whois.apnic.netFor US Military: whois.nic.mil 
For US Government: whois.nic.gov 
For US non-military and non-gov: whois.internic.net NOTE!!! Whois.internic.net doesn't work the way this Digest says any more. Instead, click here to learn the new way to use it.

For the server on Australian locations use the Asia pacific one. 
And if you don't want to use whois.internic.net, you can users.internic.net 
Pratically the same, and I don't know any different. Probably owned by 
different companies, but I couldn't care less.

 *** Answer to Reg file Question from GTMHH 
================================================================== 
From: MadMan <madman593@yahoo.com>

A while ago Randy Hunt had a question about saving his newly edited 
.reg files.  He said that he edited it in Wordpad and that if it was 
saved, all formatting would be lost.  You can fix this easily by 
editing the *.reg file in Notepad instead of Wordpad.  You can also 
rename it in Windows Explorer, File Manager, or DOS.

Hope this helps.
