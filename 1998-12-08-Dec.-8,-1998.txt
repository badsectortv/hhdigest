 *** New Editor 
________________________________________________________________________

 You will soon be seeing new Happy Hacker Digests, this time with two 
editors. We haven't yet decided on who will edit a Digest series on Windows 
and beginner hacking.  However, those of you who are more advanced will be 
excited to learn that Gerry Mullins will put out a Digest on Unix and 
advanced hacking topics.  We got many other offers fro help from talented 
and knowledgeable people, and hope that they will also help out by writing 
for the Digests, or perhaps even writing GTMHHs.

 Gerry Mullins has experience with the Linux, HPUX, SUN OS 4.3.1, Solaris 
2.6, and AT&T SVR3 varieties of Unix.  As an "Engineering and Scientific 
Consultant" he runs a Unix help desk as his daily job, and moonlights 
teaching "UNIX for Advanced Users" at a technical college.  Mullins also 
edits the Avatar MUD weekly newsletter, and writes editorials for each issue. 

 Please email your questions about Unix and other advanced topics to Mullins 
at unixeditor@techbroker.com.

* Don't want people snooping on you when you go online?  See Lady 
Whitewolf's privacy tips, linked from our home page, http://www.happyhacker.org.

* And, while you are at our home page, click on the link to the FBI files on 
humor columnist Mike Royko.  It will take you to an archive at 
http://www.apbonline.com/gfiles of FBI files on many celebrities.  It seems 
that the FBI just cannot resist snooping on famous folks.  Gosh, now that 
the FBI is bothering her, does this mean Meinel is getting famous too?

* Erratum:  In the last Inside Happy Hacker announcement we gave the URL for 
the screen shot of EtherPeek detecting a stealth ports scan as 
http://www.happyhacker.org/Epscreen-fin.JPG.  The correct URL was

Maximum Security : A Hacker's Guide to Protecting Your Internet Site and 
Network 

List Price:$49.99  
Amazon.com price: $39.99  
You Save:$10.00 (20%)  
Availability: This title usually ships within 
2-3 days. 

Paperback - 829 pages 2nd Bk&cdr edition September 1998)   
Sams; ISBN: 0672313413 ; Dimensions (in inches): 2.19 x 9.07 x 7.36  
                                         
   You can tell right away that the author of Maximum Security knows a thing 
or two about the hacker scene because he (yes, it is a "he") decided to 
write anonymously.  According to the first edition, "In the late 1980s, the 
author was convicted of a series of financial crimes after developing a 
technique to circumvent bank security in Automatic Teller Machine systems." 

  However, Maximum Security is not just another haxsploitation book such as 
Secrets of a Superhacker or Forbidden Secrets of the Legion of Doom Hackers. 
It is up to date.  It discusses how to break into and defend Unix, Windows 
NT, Macintosh, Novell and VMS systems.   It covers everything from port 
scanners to denial of service attacks.  Most important, it provides URLs 
which can be linked from the CD-ROM that comes with the book to the best 
sites to get tools to attack or defend all of today's most important 
computer systems. 

    If you are a newbie, Maximum Security will leave you scratching your 
head.  It offers no keystroke-by-keystroke explanations of how to break into 
computers. This book assumes the reader is already familiar with networking 
and programming.  However, anyone who is a systems 
administrator, or who has absorbed the basics taught at the Happy Hacker web 
site or in The Happy Hacker book should find Maximum Security to be the most 
valuable hacker handbook on the planet. 

    It's one of the best-selling computer security books today.  Its first 
printing is said to have sold out in just two weeks! -- Carolyn Meinel 

PS.  Just who is "Anonymous"?  According to Winn Schwartau, he's William Wagner.

You can find Maximum Security for sale at the Happy Hacker bookstore at 
http://www.happyhacker.org/general.htm#Maximum Security.  This provides a 
click through to purchase it directly from Amazon.com.

From: Lord Chr0n0s <hismajesty@portzer0.8m.com>

http://www.developer.com/reference/r_library.html contains lots of books on 
Unix, Linux, TCP/IP, programming, and more, and is better than mpc.com in my 
opinion.

From: "ELECTRICzero" <ELECTRICzero@prodigy.net>

    I just read your review of "The Watchman" and basically agreed with your 
analysis, Littman seemed to be on Paulsens side. Kevin; however, seems to be 
against this book... (at) http://catalog.com/kevin/ there is a quite amusing 
quiz on the book there also. 
 

Happy hacking, folks!
