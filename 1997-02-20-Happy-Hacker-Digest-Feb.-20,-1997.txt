IRC GTMHH UPDATE

Moderator: We have gotten some really great additional information as well 
as corrections (and flames) on the GTMHH on IRC. Hang on, I'm wearing 
asbestos and trying to verify and sort out the conflicting information. 
Since so many people contributed to the writing of that Guide, to print the 
flames would violate our rules for no flaming unless people consent. But 
when we have agreed upon the improved version, we'll send it out again. We 
also have two Beginner Series Guides in the works on how to get and start 
using a shell account and how to hack from Windows.  If I could only figure 
out how to get along without sleep we'll get soem more advanced guides out, 
too. Remember, any one who wants to write tutorials of their own is welcome 
to submit them to this list, or to collaborate with me.

MICROSOFT IIS AND ACTIVE SERVER ADVISORY 
                 Security Hole in ASP Discovered in Microsoft ASP 
                                February 20, 1997 
Description:

A serious security hole was found in Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) 
by Juan T. Llibre <j.llibre@codetel.net.do>. This hole allows Web clients to 
download unprocessed ASP files potentially exposing user ids and passwords. 
ASP files are the common file type used by Microsoft's IIS and Active Server 
to perform server-side processing.

How it works:

To download an unprocessed ASP file, simply append a period to the asp URL. 
For example: http://www.domain1.com/default.asp becomes 
http://www.domain1.com/default.asp. With the period appendage, Internet 
Information Server (IIS) will send the unprocessed ASP file to the Web 
client, wherein the source to the file can be examined at will. If the 
source includes any security parameter designed to allow access to other 
system processes, such as an SQL  database, they will be revealed.

Defense:

There are two known ways to stop this behavior:

1.Turn read permissions off of the ASP directory in the Internet Service 
Manager. This may not be a practical solution since many sites mix ASP and 
HTML files. If your site mixes these files together in the same directories, 
you may want to segregate them immediately. Now and in the future, treat 
your ASP files like any other Web based executable, and keep them in 
separate directories wherein permissions can be adjusted accordingly.

2.Download this filter written by Christoph Wille

Broadcast Fax and Junk Email Illegal

Under United States law, it is unlawful "to use any telephone facsimile 
machine, computer, or other 
device to send an unsolicited advertisement" to any "equipment which has the 
capacity (A) to 
transcribe text or images (or both) from an electronic signal received over 
a regular telephone line 
onto paper." The law allows individuals to sue the sender of such illegal 
"junk mail" for $500 per 
copy. Most states will permit such actions to be filed in Small Claims Court.

Here is the text of the federal law:

I would dare say you aren't relatively experienced. Right now I can tell 
you of a certain college system that has just over a dozen machines 
vulnerable to 'froot'. Some systems keep up to date with advisory info and 
patch those holes. More often than not, they go untouched.

What?! Fine. Call me up and social engineer your way into my system since 
it is "the only way to absolutely get into a remote system". When you are 
banging your head against the wall in frustration because I won't give you 
what you want, then reconsider your thoughts.

No it isn't. Physical trespassing is a world apart from a piece of email 
exploiting a weak sendmail.

Hardly been explored?! Come on! I haven't run into a hacker that doesn't 
know the value of SE attacks. And I think you will find that most Tiger 
Teams not only do it, but push it as an essential part of security 
testing. I know my team does.

You really should mention that with sendmail, versions like 8.7.5 are good 
as a LOCAL way of getting increased access. Remote 8.7.5 vulnerabilities 
are basically unheard of to the 'underground' as well as security 
consultants.

IRC 7th SPHERE QUESTION

From: Redington <nemesis@minot.com>

I went to 7th sphere the other day a downloaded their sphere.zip file. 
I unzipped it and tried to open in and to install it inside of my mIRC 
app, but it keeps giving me error messages like "Setup is unable to 
find_SETUP.DLL, which is needed to complete the installation, Error 
103."  What is that? The thing is that the SETUP.DLL file is right 
there.  If anyone can help me out on how to set that up it is very much 
appreciated.

The passed file is NOT shadowed. The * in the password field marks that 
login has been disabled for that account. Have you noticed that when you 
view a password file on some systems (not through ftp), some accounts 
have * and others have jumbled text? And in the case that you download 
the file, it is useless. You can not "decrypt" the passwords, nor can 
you log into the accounts.

It's not just you. I find that social engineering and "physical" hacking are 
the best ways in. Without a doubt, the human interface is the weakest link in 
almost all systems I have ever seen. We recently had a friendly competition in 
the CIS department at my school (professor approved) to see if any one could 
gain root access to our experimental server. Being quite green in the area of 
exploits, I opted for a "physical" hack. I "found" my professor's briefcase and 
after sifting thru loads of junk, found scribbled on a post-it note

user: duke 
pass 68 81 85 77 65 88 73 70

...gee I wonder. Well, no one else was able to gain access, but everyone said I 
cheated. Is there a moral? Sysadmins, sometimes hackers cheat, patches aren't 
everything.

Moderator: I decided to approve the following post because Rogue Agent gives 
better hints for people who need to secure their systems than he does for 
those who want to break in. A big plus with RA is that he encourages his 
readers to think and learn for themselves -- just enough to tantalize, but 
not so much that you could immediately land in jail trying this stuff out. 
And, for those of you new to the list, when you see the flames below, don't 
worry. We only allow flames against people who *like* to get flamed on this

[...] 
| p.s.s Are there any known bugs/vulnerabilities in Identd?

I did a websearch at www.excite.com with "identd AND security AND hole" 
and came up with 469 hits.  There's some overlap, duplicates and false 
positives, but still more than enough valid hits to satisfy you.

| Moderator: I made this one anonymous. Sheesh, guys, please remember what I 
| have in the header of every digest: "Please don't send us anything you

Oh please.  They would not, any more than you would if a bank robber asked 
you for the fastest way to the next town because his wife had an accident 
there, and you gave him directions.

To answer his question, here's hints on some potential holes in his 
friend's machine:

|      echo on port 7 
|      discard on port 9

echo kicks out a constant stream of characters.  discard takes in any 
characters you feed it.  Figure out how to hook one into the other, and 
you've got an excellent denial of service attack as his machine and 
network overload on feeding stuff to itself.

|      exec on port 512 
|      login on port 513 
|      shell on port 514

exec is for rexec, login is for rlogin, shell is for rsh.  All 3 have 
abusable trust relationship problems ("+ +" in .rhosts or /etc/hosts.equiv 
and anyone anywhere on the Net can do anything they want on the machine). 
All 3 also have other problems, including hostname spoofing, buffer 
overflows, inherited environment variables.  Don't forget the classic 
rlogin -froot linux/AIX hole.

There's a world of possibility here, if you know how to exploit it.

|      finger on port 79

Hey, now you know some usernames for use with the last 3.  Always a bonus.

|      ftp on port 21

wu-ftpd has had several problems, for instance the infamous SITE EXEC 
hole.

|      smtp on port 25

sendmail -is- a hole.  It gets a security upgrade once a month, on 
average.

|      sunrpc on port 111

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call.  It's a way to run part of a command 
on a remote machine.  NFS and NIS are the two best-known services that use 
RPC.  Both have holes you can drive a truck through.

|      telnet on port 23

telnet's had a few problems too; accepting environment variables, buffer 
overflows.

|      uucp on port 540--

What with all the increase in speed and connections all over, UUCP's kind 
of a dinosaur.  But it's got its share of holes too.  Lots of way old ones 
written up years ago in g-philes and Phrack, and probably some of the same 
newer ones every other service is prone to (overflows, env vars, etc).

| What direction should I head in next?

First off I'd stop listening to Carolyn's blather about how neat "ports" 
are, and start looking at the services behind them.  She's given the false 
impression that finding a port that accepts connections is central to 
breaking security on a machine.  "Hey, you've got ftp open.  ftp has 
holes.  I can break into your machine!", "Hey, you've got ssh open.  ssh 
has holes.  I can break into your machine!", "Hey, you've got finger open. 
finger has holes.  I can break into your machine!".

Do you notice that she never says -how- to exploit ftp, ssh or finger to 
break into machines?  She says it's an ethics thing, that telling newbies 
would be irresponsible.  But what she doesn't tell you is that SHE DOESN'T 
KNOW HOW.  Carolyn Meinel is a clueless newbie of the first order.

If you want to learn security (defensive or offensive), stop piddling 
about with "ports" and start learning services; how they work, what they 
do, what resources they use, what the known problems with each are.  The 
most effective way to do that is to play with the program itself, both 
client and server, on a machine you have full (root) access to.  Then do a 
websearch for security FAQs and mailing list archives (bugtraq, 
linux-security, best-of-security, etc.) and read up on the security 
problems it has, taking note of what versions are vulnerable in what OS. 
Finally start building a collection of exploits, from those same 
websearches.

If you've done all that, you can start calling yourself a hacker.  You've 
studied the thing, played with it, understand how it works & how to break 
it.

| Moderator: Here's another one I figured I'd better make anonymous:

| tried the "cat" command: 
| cat - views the inside of a file.

| SH**. 
| Could this be that the victim's password is just a user right? 
| What command do I give to know my rights in Unix? (in novel it's simply 
| "rights"maybe, if my memory serves me right) What tricks do I do so that I 
| can manipulated the passwd file?

Hacking isn't "tricks".  I know Carolyn's given you that impression, but 
she's wrong.  Hacking is knowing, because you looked at it yourself, 
played with it yourself, studied it yourself.  Buy a book on Unix, get it 
from the library or do a websearch for online tutorials (there's plenty 
out there, some of them quite good).

DIY.  You can if you want to.

Depends on where you look.  Some places have old versions of important

SEing takes b****, imagination and quick thinking.  Not everybody can

True. Although Macs are as easy to DS as others, they also have the 
conventions of not having been hacked much, and not having conventional 
interfaces, conventional meaning UNIX. =) Lots of people spend their time 
on UNIX or DOS based systems- the Mac file system and file sharing system 
are VERY different from them, no matter how it might seem. The easiest 
way to hack a Mac is FROM a Mac.

Think, though, how long NT has been out compared to the Mac. Apple was 
selling Mac server solutions years ago... and it's still doing it. With 
the new system, I could see sales going even higher. All apple needs to 
do now is buy Quarterdeck, and make webstar part of the OS... =)
