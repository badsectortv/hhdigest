*** CALL FOR GLUTTONS FOR PUNISHMENT 
===============================================================================

   The Happy Hacker project to teacher basics has become *too* 
   successful. Lots of our 2000 readers are complaining that we are 
   overloading them with information.

   Is there anyone who would be willing to moderate an intermediate 
   hacker education list? That way the newbies won't have to put up 
   with baffling Unix wizard details, and the more advanced hackers 
   don't have to read about IRC wars and Win95 tricks.

   Advantages: lots of media attention, and a chance to build your 
   reputation.  This could lead to a career as a computer security 
   consultant, journalist or narc! (Just kidding! The FBI is too cheap 
   to hire more narcs.)

   Disadvantages: lots of media attention, work for no pay, have to 
   put up with flames and rumors that you are a narc, get hit by email 
   bombs and people cracking into your Internet hosts and wiping 
   system files.

   I would also like to hand over moderation of the Happy Hacker list 
   to someone who would agree to our policies on flame control, no 
   boasting about breaking the law, no naughty words, and spelling and 
   grammar control.

   If anyone would be kind enough to take on all this moderator work, 
   I would have time to turn out a bunch more Guides to (mostly) 
   Harmless Hacking.

   Never fear, if no one comes forward, I'm keeping up this work. But 
   it would sure be fun to have time to finish up all those 
   half-written Guides to (mostly) Harmless Hacking!

   email address isn't currently getting email bombed. Hint: I own the 
   techbroker domain name so any user name @cmeinel.com gets to me.

      First, I would check out: http://www.feist.com/~tqdb/texts/hacknov.html 
   for a very good Novell Netware security reference.  I don't think any 
   Novell admin should be without a copy.

      Second, unless you are able to brute force hack the password of an 
   account with administrative privileges you'll probably just have to 
   physically power down your server.  The main problem with this whole 
   situation is your lack of a keyboard right now.  If I understood 
   correctly rebooting the server should re-enable the keyboard so you can 
   get back to work.  Just try to make sure that all users are logged off 
   and files are closed before shutting the server down.

      Third, basically look through the Hacking Novell Netware FAQ and pay 
   particularly close attention to the sections on how to recover the 
   administrator password.  This should be the final step in gaining 
   supervisory control over the server again.  Then tell your company to 
   file suit against the former admin..

      If all else fails, pay for some real support.

*** LINUX HELP 
===============================================================================

From: Timothy Ward <tbw@ruined.all-net.net>

   I don't know why, but there is a bit of a mystification around PPP 
   and Linux. It really is an easy task. I would suggest reading the 
   PPP-HOWTO.  Or, if the person who cannot figure it, could email me 
   directly I'd be glad to walk him/her thru it. Thanks, and have a 
   wonderful day.

From: "Stephen James" <sjamesflorida-wellington@worldnet.att.net>

   I *am* a newbie, but Linux loads well on my system.  In other 
   words: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I don't want flames and bombings 
   because somebody's system won't work.  If you read this and find 
   that you have no idea what I'm saying, DON'T try this. 
  
   The "setup" command on my Slackware Linux system makes it somewhat 
   difficult to setup LILO (LInux LOader) because of the extensive 
   prompts and menus, even though it is more secure.  Keep in mind 
   that I'm assuming you already have Linux installed.  Don't try this 
   if you know nothing about Linux.  If you don't mind hand hacking, 
   edit your /etc/lilo.conf file to look something like this.  Change 
   *only* the portions of my file that I list: 
_________________________________________________________________ 
boot = /dev/(drive Linux is on; *not* the partition) 
_________________________________________________________________ 
image = /vmlinuz 
            root = (*now* enter the partition, or the drive) 
 label = your choice (Linux?) 
_________________________________________________________________ 
other = (partition of win95) 
 label = (your choice)

*** LOOKING FOR SAN DIEGO HACKERS 
===============================================================================

From: Matt Ooi <coder@electriciti.com>

   I've seen a lot of people posting requests for hackers in their 
   area... any San Diego hackers out there?

   Well, I do have a legitimate question. Under Linux, is there any 
   way to shell out of procmail or sendmail, short of ^Z (Suspend)? If 
   not, how about sasteroids? The reason I ask is because on my system 
   I noticed they have suid/gid permissions and are a potential 
   security hole: should someone be able to shell out of them, they 
   would effectively be root.

   hullo there, jay!

   cookies are tiny bits of information on yourself that are saved on 
   to your hard disk by a web server. I'm sure you've encountered 
   websites which greet you when you log on to them and allow you to 
   customize what u want to see. or those shopping mall sites where 
   you surf around and put your purchases in a shopping cart.

   all the info used in these systems are saved in your local computer 
   via a cookie. each web site saves its own cookie in your hard disk.

   cookies are annoying and controversial. but some think they're 
   better saved on your HD than on the web servers HD!

   Uh...I read the hacker Crackdown, too, but I recall that it was the 
   phone company that busted the MOD, not LOD. I believe Chris was 
   arrested also.  Then Chris & Co. set up the Security firm. MOD 
   messed with them and they started complaining to the FBI. The 
   business went under, MOD went to jail, got out of jail, got jobs. 
   It has been a while since I read the book.

Moderator: 
  
   You can get details of the role LOD played in busting MOD in the 
   book _Information Warfare_ by Winn Schwartau, chapter 11. Since 
   Winn has worked closely with Goggans (sorry, I mispelled his name 
   earlier), I am inclined to believe Winn's version of the story.

*** X WINDOWS TRICK 
===============================================================================

Anonymous:

   I've noticed a little feature in the network of our school that 
   could be interested for "happy hackers," since I'm talking of 
   "internal hacking" (this thing won't work outside your network, I 
   think) and it won't damage anything.

   We are running a network on AIX version 4 with IBM (NCD) X 
   Terminals ; the X Window version running on this network is release 5

   Now to the interesting part : when a X workstation closes its 
   current session, there are two seconds before the magic cookie is 
   installed ; so you can open a display to any workstation if you 
   connect to it in these two seconds.

   But why is it useful ? Simple ! When you have a display attached to 
   a workstation, you keep it until the current X session is over ; 
   that means you just have to wait for someone to log on this 
   station, and after he's connected just send a XDisableAccessControl 
   to the display you have created This will cause the workstation to 
   disable its magic cookie (as if the user typed xhost +)

   And then you can do everything you want on this workstation ...  If 
   someone is interested, my next post could be how to have fun with a 
   workstation in xhost + : how to kill processes, log keys, send 
   unremoveable windows, make the station beep and a lot of other 
   harmless things :)

   Now to be clearer a simple program that could do this: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
/* When you include all there are never problems :) */

#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
#include <X11/X.h> 
#include <X11/Xlib.h> 
#include <X11/Intrinsic.h> 
#include <X11/StringDefs.h> 
#include <X11/Xutil.h> 
#include <X11/Shell.h>

main () 
{ Display *d; 
  char c;

  d=XOpenDisplay("funny_station");

  if (d==NULL) { printf("Error,access denied\n"); exit(0); } 
  
  fflush(stdin); 
  c=getchar();

  /* Now just wait for someone to log on */

  XDisableAccessControl(d);

  /* And the workstation is in xhost + */ }

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
   You compile this with gcc -lX11 
   Simple and short no ?

   Now the questions :

   * What systems are subject to this "bug" ; I checked another AIX in another 
     school and you could "connect" this way on every "unlogged" 
     station, there wasn't any two seconds limit (and so was our 
     network before I told our admin ... so perhaps all AIX systems 
     have the session manager configured this way on default) ; I 
     think that it doesn't work with HP terminals ?

   So please if you want to do something useful, stop pinging on IRC 
   and email bombing and check if this works on your nearest 
   workstation :) 
  
   * I don't think that this will work "outside" since the 
     XDisableAccessControl only works if the station that sends this command 
     is on the same domain that the one which started the session ? Or does it ? 
  
   * Could it work with X11 release 6 ? 
  
   * It is safe because you can't get passwords easily on the "login session" 
     (xlogin on AIX) : the login window doesn't accept changing its 
     attributes to KeyPressEvent or KeyReleaseEvent ; you just have to 
     wait for a telnet :)

   So I think that a good idea would be to begin a list of funny things to do 
   on X Window like this one ... I am just a beginner in C and I think this 
   system has a lot of potential for a hacker :)

   In conclusion, if this is published, PLEASE TEST IT ON YOUR WORKSTATIONS and 
   let's make a summary of harmless weaknesses in different X-Window systems !

   I have a Compaq Presario 9660 and it came with this little fun 
   program called "Presario Vault". What this program does is hide any 
   selected folders and/or files and keeps them locked with a master 
   password and a password for the individual file. So I, being the 
   smart-ass that I am, decided to hide some useless files and put in 
   some worthless passwords that I would forget. Now I am trying to find 
   a way to get to the files without a password. I have torn the 
   registry apart and looked in every INI file.. Would anyone know about 
   this program and how to break it??

   To edit the windows help screen (the one that comes up when you 
   boot up windows), click the start button on the task bar, click 
   run, and type in REGEDIT.  that will take you to the registry 
   editor.  Once there, go into the dir:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS\CURRENTVERSION\EXPLORER\TIPS

   Double click on the line that you want to edit (on the right frame) 
   and go for it.

   Also, to make the start button go quicker without the delays, go 
   into the regedit program like you did above --^ and then go into 
   the dir:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\control panel\desktop in this dir look 
   for a value called menushowdelay and hit enter twice.  Then, set 
   the value to 100. Its probably set at 400 right now. You'll have 
   to reboot to see any change.

   This idea is terrible, and I'll tell you why.  Firstly, a spam is 
   something that in Usenet usually refers to something that is 
   completely off topic, and most likely an ad.  If you would post the 
   GTMHH every time someone spammed, you would have become a spammer. 
   You would have posted something which has no relevance to the 
   Newsgroup, and if, as you said, you would post it EVERY time 
   someone spammed, you would fill the newsgroups with GTMHHs, and 
   therefore be a particularly annoying spammer.  To stop spammers, 
   follow the GTMHH or mailbomb their a**, I find no ethical problem 
   with mailbombing a spammer AS LONG AS you do not damage the ISP in 
   the process, and my respect for US computer legislation only goes 
   so far (so far being two inches from my nose).  But the "fight fire 
   with fire" concept won't work here.  You wanna get back at a 
   spammer, you do so, but don't make other people read more spams. 
   If they want to do something they'll do it, there is info on 
   fighting spam widely available on the net.

         ;-) every body!! 
   Just one thing : Stop talking about email bomb :-@ 
   Email bombing is not hacking for me. Hacking can be noble. 
   Hacking is gaining information. 
   It's more interesting for me to discover new tricks or new bugs 
   than get bored with email bomb. 
   Every body have lost the meaning of the word "Hacking". 
   Here in France Hackers are very vulnerable (DST, DGSE) because they 
   have done rubbish like e bomb, or cracking Transpac connections to 
   have free phone connections. 
         I respect people who respect the other. What do you think about that?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
From: plowsky@juno.com (plowsky d phreak)

   I couldn't agree more, email bombing and destructive hacking is 
   exactly what gives the word 'hackers' a bad meaning in the public 
   eye. I've been mail bombed many times, and I guarantee that it took 
   longer for them to send the bombs than it did for me to clean them 
   up. This kind of childish behavior shouldn't be considered hacking 
   by anyone...

   You know, this is really getting sad. This mailing list is made for 
   the Newbie who has gotten up the nerve, courage, and/or guts to 
   dive into this vast and never ending world of "hacking". Some of 
   the self professed "hackers" who write to this list are totally see 
   through, and fake. You are trying to Bulls**t your way through... 
   Stop wasting my/our time. If a someone asks a question, try to 
   answer it. If you don't know the answer, read they reply and learn 
   it, don't start shooting off your mouth. 99% (dare I say 100%) of 
   the information you need to know if on the Internet...

   Ask a question about something, someone will answer it and then 
   once you have a lead, pursue it. Real simple. If the Moderator 
   would be a little more responsible and post e-mail that had some 
   value to this list, this mailing list would lose the "tarnished" 
   image it is quickly gained around the net.  This list has turned 
   into a 30% flame war, 30% Moderators personal problems and 
   opinions, and 40% about what this list is really about. This 40% is 
   why most of you subscribed (I hope).

   Every time I read one of the Happy Hackers, I learn something, or 
   remember something I had forgotten (well 40% of the time I 
   do).......

   PS. do you think I can have my .sig NOT cut off this as usual?
