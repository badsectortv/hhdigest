 *** Infowar IRC Update 
===========================================================

Carolyn: Despite warnings from the National Computer Security Association 
that a gang of computer vandals was going to trash the Infowar IRC server 
for my visit the evening of March 27, we went on-line anyhow. We had an 
assortment of attacks. But our volunteers quelled the lamers. So we managed 
to have an entertaining evening. Thanks to all! Following is Supreme IRC Cop 
Betty's report on Infowar IRC copdom:

From: "Betty G. O'Hearn" <betty@infowar.com>

Hello everyone.

Two news items...

Wolfkill has been added as an IRCop and

Leprekon has been named Coordinator.

This will bring our op pool to 7 which hopefully should be able to give us 
some coverage around the clock. We are also representing several time zones.

Thank you for your assistance and willingness to work for free! lol  This 
will be a good resume builder for you also.  You work/manage for free.... 
but you gain tremendous experience and personal/professional growth. I will 
give you a glowing recommendation for your future job search.

We have the Coordinator to relieve WebWarrior and me of administrative 
duties.  I know he will do a great job.

We are running a series of WebEvents... so we will need some man power.  Lep 
can coordinate all the security/protections he thinks we need.  As you know 
the first one was March 27 with Carolyn.  Then we will start a 4series next 
week on Terrorism...( in another room)  so someone will need to man that 
channel and also Winn Schwartau will be featured along the away along with 
several names that are very prominent in the field of Infowar and Infosec. 
The Coordinator will arrange for all coverage.

All Web Events will be logged.

WebWarrior is putting a ListServ into place so you may communicate among 
yourselves.  We will also have an irc@infowar account.

Wolfkill has developed a InfoServ bot which will be an aid to you. Thank you 
Wolfkill.... please make the final what-ever-it-is- you do to keep the thing 
working around the clock.

I don't want things to get complicated here, but bear in mind we are unique 
because the people who visit us are in the field.... so we don't have day to 
day IRC traffic that fills the channel with nonsense.  We want to have fun 
here, but we also want to learn/teach hacking and associated exploits that 
are legal.  I cannot stress how important the legal aspect is.  If we loose 
that focus, and someone sees illegal activities discussed, it will hurt all 
of our credibility.

As you know it is my vision to have this infowar hacker channel an example 
of good control, being a  pleasant  place with manners to newbies (and 
everyone), and to build the traffic. We can build a model here that will be 
unique and make help in our way to make the Internet a better place.  As you 
may or may not know, Mr. Winn Schwartau has been very supportive of hackers. 
We appreciate him for his support of this irc venture.

As you know, we will not tolerate any nonsense as wars and similar silly 
wastes of energy.  I know the team here is very mature for their ages and 
responsible, and we feel comfortable with Lepreken coordinating things. 
(Just don't become a hard boss Lep or I will have to spank you!)  I know 
that Lep will also run the team in a democratic fashion giving ops the 
ability to give input to issues that come up.   I stress team....

So to sum it up.... this is IRC at infowar.com    THE place to go!

Thank you all.

We are here to support you. 
Have fun and make this place great! 
Let's rock the world!

 *** Dangers of Port 19 
=================================================================

From: "Mishari \"CykiX\" Muqbil" <mishari@thepentagon.com>

The following attack seems to be working for me on my Linux box: 
telnet localhost 19|telnet localhost 7 
This puts a tremendous amount of strain on my computer and caused me to 
restart at the end. Someone should stop port 19 totally. It is a huge 
new potential for Simple but yet effective DYI Denial of Service 
attacks.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Carolyn: Thanks for bringing this up. MÍ§hÄrí mÜQßî¦ has independently 
discovered a little-known, yet devastating denial of service attack. There 
is absolutely no excuse for leaving port 19 (the chargen -- character 
generator port) open to the outside world.

Since rumor has it that a Windows 95 program may be released for download 
tomorrow that might automate these port 19 attacks, it would be a good idea 
to disable this port on all computers with Internet connectivity NOW. Sorry, 
I won't give out the URL for the download site or even the program name as I 
don't want to make it too easy for any lamers reading this to get the program.

To disable port 19 on a Unix box, go into etc/inet/conf look and edit 
chargen by commenting out the two line of UDP and TCP (put a # in front to 
comment them out). This tip is courtesy of Gerard Cochrane Jr., a systems 
administrator at the University of Texas at El Paso.

To disable port 19 on an NT box, you have several options:

1. The most is not to permit it through your router. (This should also work 
on Unix boxes.) 
2. By not installing the "Simple TCP Services" you do not install 
Chargen, Echo, Quote of the Day, etc... servers. Since none of these is 
essential for the average NT server, why invited trouble by installing that 
feature? 
3. You can also disable port 19 in NT 4.0 through the use of the Advanced 
port filtering feature. 
4. Finally, you can disable any of the individual Simple TCP Services by 
changing a value in: 
  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/SimpTCP/Parameters

EnableTCPChargen = 0 (defaults to 0x01 = enabled) 
EnableUDPChargen = 0 (defaults to 0x01 = enabled)

You will see a list of all the servers in this key and can alter their 
listening states accordingly.

 *** !!!!!:)GALF;)!!!!! 
===========================================================

From: wraith@dimensional.com

Ahhh!  GALF speaks.  I assume from the tone of his last post that Jericho 
speaks on behalf of GALF or is directly a representative of that 
organization.  If not, I write in vain. 
My recent letter though harsh and designed mostly to get a response directly 
from GALF, I believe held several viable points.

1.) COOL and FOOL are only 1 letter apart...... didn't take much to turn 
your peers against you did it?  GO figure.

2.) Messing with the Happy Hacker, who is the one who graciously provides 
this forum for you to expectorate upon in the first place, is the same as 
picking on a little kid (no offense C) and if you are cool you will show 
chivalry, PARTICULARLY in times of war.  We must always leave neutrality 
open as an option.

3.) We MUST retain the right to regulate the Internet ourselves for without 
it there would be no battlefield upon which to earn our dignity. If you 
continue you will force the man down on ALL OF US.  Unless that's what you 
want???????

4.) I propose we meet and discuss amongst ourselves the possibilities and 
concerns of all involved before GALF gets itself put out of commission.

From: GR8GUY <cyoung@northernnet.com>

I just don't see how me especially and most people can compete with GALF in 
the computer hacking area you know! I mean you can and others but not me or 
most of us! Not that I would not try if it came down to it but... 
so the best way I can think of is it to attack their popularity! And I now 
know that gets to them even more then trying to hack them! After all 
"sometimes its better to fight with your head then with brawn"! I'm really 
glad I'm now on your list and caught up with you guys! You definitely have a 
awesome group and thing going on...and best of all it's mostly legal..and 
happy :o)!!!

Carolyn: You both make good points. If we use social pressure -- not illegal 
computer vandalism!-- to encourage guys like GALF and email bomber angry 
johnny into quitting their lamerfests, we can keep the Internet free. But if 
this rash of destructive denial of service attacks and hacking into ISPs 
continues, the day will arrive that the government will crack down on *all 
hackers*. A government authority powerful enough to control the entire 
worldwide scope of the Internet would be frighteningly powerful. Anything we 
can do as hackers to curb the destructiveness of Internet vandals is a blow 
for freedom and for keeping power out of the hands of Big Government.

No.. because you CAN'T take out GALF. Don't front Carolyn. It has been 
proved several times you are incompetent when it comes to hacking.

> rooted GALF!!!*&%@##!!!" Ahem, seems a little childish. Sheesh, besides,

Stop your stupid s*** Carolyn, you look really ignorant. What part of our 
original agreement are you ignoring here? What part of "you and you alone" 
did you miss? You have already broken that agreement by letting your 
uber-hacker friends at UTEP f*** with my system. I said YOU could try to 
hack my system. Catch a clue and pass it along to your friends.

As for 'scared', I don't think so. Like I have said a MILLION F***ING 
TIMES before this..  If I want to hack 'dockmaster', do you think they 
will give me an account there knowing my intentions? Of course not. So, 
just like everyone else, you get to try to hack my box like a regular 
hacker would. Petty insults and calling me 'scared' will not help your 
chances. You are a p***-poor social engineer, give it up.

And like I said long ago, I won't narc anyone for trying to hack my box. I 
think that is pretty apparent from past attacks, but technically.. I have a 
legitimate right to mail UTEP and complain about the UTEP admins. But, I 
will sit back and let them try to hack the box too. Of course, if they do 
get in for some reason, make sure you remind them to back up their own system.

You are lame.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Carolyn: 
1) The supposedly dire hacking attempt on jericho from the University of 
Texas at El Paso (UTEP) was merely a port scanner. Word to the wise -- 
please don't port scan jericho's obscure.foobar.org, it gives him 
conniptions! However, it is legal to do so. Watch out, jericho, my next 
visit may be from the account galfina@escape.com. 
2)Crackers who rm system files, as GALF has done in the past at UTEP and as 
jericho appears to be threatening to do to them again, are breaking the law 
and acting REALLY lame. Besides, that buffalo.utep.edu box that GALF 
fourletter worded over was set up with the sole purpose of acting as a lure 
to get data on GALF. GALF is easy to social engineer, and I am patient:) 
3)Both GALF and angry johnny -- both of whom jericho so emotionally defends 
-- have been far more destructive than Kevin Mitnick or even Kevin Poulson 
ever were. And look where those guys are now. GALF, angry johnny, do you 
quit while you're still free, or do you find out how compatible you are with 
your future cellmate "Spike"?

I have a really nice tutorial on sending fake email via port 25. Its quite 
an old file so the mail server lists may be out of date , however the 
method is exactly the same now.

It is _hard_ links that cannot be made across partitions/drives. 
_Symbolic_ links can cross drives.  But this doesn't have the desired 
effect, naturally:

val@localhost<~>$ ls -l dead.letter 
lrwxrwxrwx   1 val      2147           20 Mar 27 18:15 dead.letter -> 
/etc/security/shadow 
^^^this is where my system keeps the "real" passwd file

val@localhost<~>$ echo "attempted_password_entry" >> dead.letter 
bash: dead.letter: Permission denied 
val@boris<~>$

From: "Otter" <otter@starnetinc.com>

 I love the GTMHH series.  Right now I'm running Win 95 and working on 
getting FreeBSD and NT running.  Quick question is NT Server better for 
hacking or Workstation.  I used to work at a software store so I'm in NFR 
heaven.  I think server would be better.  Should I use a combo of the two. I 
have enough disk space, and system commander.  Any input would help. Thanks!

Otter 
otter@starnetinc.com

Carolyn: Since you have enough disk space, I'd advise both workstation and 
server. Here's an Evil Genius tip: the kernels of both NT server and 
workstation appear to be identical. You just need to change some settings in 
the Registry. Because Microsoft doesn't like people doing that themselves 
instead of paying the extra $800 for the server configuration, in NT 4.0 
this is pretty difficult. (It's trivial in NT 3). There is a program 
floating around that does this for you. It's named NTTune 3.0. You will have 
a hard time finding it, however, because the Microsoft lawyers have been 
ferociously hunting down and destroying its download sites.

From: PsyChadEl

Ever since my first posting on the list regarding KeyLoggers that operate 
under any of the Windows environments, I've gotten a lot of emails. Here's 
what is upcoming for those of you who are interested:

1. Yes I did hex a Windows keylogger. It was pretty shit as it wrote to 
multiple files and took forever to locate what you were looking for. 
However, I hexed it so it wrote to only one file.

2. That wasn't good enough - it still wasn't hidden. I've found a way to 
hide it and am currently working on automating the process.

3. YES... the new release is going to be out soon. I'll post the web 
address here as to where you can find it and any other information as such. 
I'm almost done with it (I had no time to work on it for a number of 
weeks)... and so you'll all have it at your fingertips fairly soon. It'll be 
pretty simple to use and yet effective - especially for those who want to 
know who's been snooping on their personal computers.

I guess that's about it...

 *** Update from the Front on the War Against Spam 
=================================================================

SPAM BLOCK

A California software engineer takes the annoyance caused by unsolicited 
e-mail messages seriously, and has developed an anti-spam weapon he plans to 
unveil next month.  Dead Bolt allows online users to share their 
"blacklists" of spam purveyors so that they can more effectively filter 
offending e-mail.  "The problem now is that everyone who is filtering is 
keeping their own blacklists and they're not working together to tie their 
lists together in a meaningful way," says Dead Bolt's creator.  "What I hope 
my package will do is allow people to work together over the Net and filter 
all this stuff out and finally put these people out of business....The 
problem is that it costs the sender virtually zero dollars to send out a 
million messages, and even if the response rate is minuscule by all 
standards -- say .001 percent -- they've made money.  So from an economic 
selfish point of view, it's in their interest to annoy the other 99.99 
percent of the people."  (Miami Herald 24 Mar 97)

well your introduction is pretty cool ... so let me ask, do you know

trouble finding someone who wants to apply my kind of finite-state analysis 
to Java ISDN hacking. Take a look at my ISDN manual and you'll see where I'm 
heading: http://www.uwm.edu/~veda/Isdn 
It all fits together but I can't really make it fly until I find that wild

[sorry for the grammar]

I was on IRC after you left and I was talking with 2 people and it came 
up about logs on UNIX [and the flavors]. If I were to run files or

Anonymous post

Here is a warning for the newbies.  I have detected in my travels a new 
program that sysadmins are using and giving themselves a big pat on the 
back...  This program is attached to daemons that control the various ports 
on a computer....You know all about that.

Well,  this new program acts like this......

Say I do a telnet to AOL.COM *just an example*...If AOL.COM has this new 
program,  it automatically dispatches a remailer to my host ISP.  This is 
not funny either.

One such message appeared like this....

...Your client has attempted to access a restricted port on our server 
*date*...*time*....Please contact Joe Blow at iamalozer.com for more 
information. 
Now...The interesting part of this program is it does not discriminate for 
legal port entry.  Therefore,  an ISP who lacks an IQ will not understand 
the legalities of this and close a newbies account without so much as a 
second thought.  This new program breaks the freedom of information laws,  a 
direction I see the net taking on a daily basis.

I surf ports to see who the server admins are that are placing the web pages 
on the net and that is it.  Without the ability to port surf,  this will 
limit access to persons responsible for spam,  mailbombs,  kiddie 
porn....Hell,  you get the idea.

Carolyn: Yes, some people get really paranoid about having their ports 
scanned (see jericho's post above). My defense is to make friends with the 
sysadmins at any ISP I hope to keep for long. So far I have only been booted 
off on account of threats from GALF, never for my own hacking activities.

Anonymous post:

I recently found that I could delete the contents of the bash-history file 
on my ISP using telnet. Logon to your shell using telnet then do something 
like a bunch of finger's and whois's. When you're finished,  use the up 
arrow to scroll back through each command you made deleting each command 
with the del key as you go, then  use the down arrow to scroll back to the 
present. You must scroll all the way back to the present for this to work so 
count the number of commands you delete if there are a lot of them.

Then type quit and logoff and the only thing that will be left in the 
bash_history file is the last quit command you did.

Does this work on other operating systems? I'd be curious to know if 
anybody can reproduce this on their ISP.

Carolyn: It doesn't work on my account at escape.com, which uses BSDI BSD/OS 2.

WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

On March 26, 1997, the Clinton Administration proposed draft legislation 
which would, for the first time, impose DOMESTIC RESTRICTIONS on the 
ability of Americans to protect their privacy and security online.

In its current form, the draft bill seeks to impose a risky 
"key-recovery" regime which would compel American citizens to ensure 
government access to their private communications. Law enforcement and 
national security agents would not even need a court order to access 
private decryption keys.

Congress is currently considering three separate bills which would 
prohibit the government from imposing "key-recovery" domestically, and 
encourage the development of easy-to-use, privacy and security tools 
for the Net.

As more and more Americans come online, the Administration's plan is a 
giant step backwards and would open a huge window of vulnerability to 
the private communications of Internet users.  Americans expect more 
when conducting private conversations with their doctors, families, 
business partners, or lawyers.

Please read the Alert below to find out what you can do to protect your 
privacy online.

WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. Adopt Your Legislator

   Now is the time to increase our ranks and prepare for the fight that 
lies 
   a head of us in Congress.  The time to blast Congress or the White House 
   with phone calls and emails will come, but now is not the appropriate 
   moment.

   Instead, please take a few minutes to learn more about this important 
   issue, and join the Adopt Your Legislator Campaign at 
   http://www.crypto.com/adopt/

   This will produce a customized page, just for you with your own 
   legislator's telephone number and address.

   In addition, you will receive the latest news and information on the 
   issue, as well as targeted alerts informing you when your 
   Representatives in Congress do something that could help or hinder 
   the future of the Internet.

   Best of all, it's free.  Do your part, Work the Network!

   Visit http://www.crypto.com/adopt/ for details.

2. Beginning Monday March 31, call the White House

   Internet public interest advocates continue to work the Hill in support 
   of the three true encryption reform bills in Congress, Pro-CODE, SAFE, & 
   ECPA II.  If you still feel a need to voice your opinion, however, you 
can 
   call the White House to express your opinion.

   Step 1 - Beginning Monday March 31, call the White House

        Call 202-456-1111 9am-5pm EST.  Ignore the voice mail survey and 
        press '0' to get a comment line operator. 
  
   Step 2 - Tell them what you think about intrusions into your privacy!

        Operator: Hello, White House comment line!

SAY     YOU: I'm calling to oppose president's Internet encryption bill. 
THIS ->      It infringes on the privacy of Americans. We need a solution 
             to the encryption issue that protects privacy, and this is not 
             it.

        Operator: Thank you, I'll pass that along to the President.

3. Spread the Word!

  Forward this Alert to your friends. Help educate the public about the 
  importance of this issue.

  Please do not forward after May 1, 1997.

WHAT'S AT STAKE

Encryption technologies are the locks and keys of the Information age 
 -- enabling individuals and businesses to protect sensitive information 
as it is transmitted over the Internet. As more and more individuals 
and businesses come online, the need for strong, reliable, easy-to-use 
encryption technologies has become a critical issue to the health and 
viability of the Net.

Current US encryption policy, which limits the strength of encryption 
products US companies can sell abroad, also limits the availability of 
strong, easy-to-use encryption technologies in the United States. US 
hardware and software manufacturers who wish to sell their products on 
the global market must either conform to US encryption export limits or 
produce two separate versions of the same product, a costly and 
complicated alternative.

The export controls, which the NSA and FBI argue help to keep strong 
encryption out of the hands of foreign adversaries, are having the 
opposite effect. Strong encryption is available abroad, but because of 
the export limits and the confusion created by nearly four years of 
debate over US encryption policy, strong, easy-to-use privacy and 
security technologies are not widely available off the shelf or "on the 
net" here in the US.

A recently discovered flaw in the security of the new digital telephone 
network exposed the worst aspects of the Administration's encryption 
policy.  Because the designers needed to be able to export their 
products, the system's security was "dumbed down".  Researchers 
subsequently 
discovered that it is quite easy to break the security of the system and 
intrude on what should be private conversations.

This incident underscores the larger policy problem: US companies are 
at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace when competing 
against companies that do not have such hindrances.  And now, for the first 
time in history, the Clinton Administration has DOMESTIC RESTRICTIONS on 
the 
ability of Americans to protect their privacy and security online.

All of us care about our national security, and no one wants to make it 
any easier for criminals and terrorists to commit criminal acts. But we 
must also recognize encryption technologies can aid law enforcement 
and protect national security by limiting the threat of industrial 
espionage and foreign spying, promote electronic commerce and protecting 
privacy.

What's at stake in this debate is nothing less than the future of 
privacy and the fate of the Internet as a secure and trusted medium for 
commerce, education, and political discourse.

 *** Brtiish Move to Restrain Use of Cryptography 
========================================================================

From: rja14@cl.cam.ac.uk (Ross Anderson) 
 

The British government's Department of Trade and Industry has sneaked out 
proposals on licensing encryption services. Their effect will be to ban PGP 
and much more besides.

I have put a copy on http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/dti.html as 
their own web server appears to be conveniently down.

Licensing will be mandatory:

      We intend that it will be a criminal offence for a body to offer 
      or provide licensable encryption services to the UK public without 
      a valid licence

The scope of licensing is broad:

      Public will be defined to cover any natural or legal person in the UK.

      Encryption services is meant to encompass any service, whether provided 
      free or not, which involves any or all of the following cryptographic 
      functionality - key management, key recovery, key certification, key 
      storage, message integrity (through the use of digital signatures) key 
      generation, time stamping, or key revocation services (whether for 
      integrity or confidentiality), which are offered in a manner which 
      allows a client to determine a choice of cryptographic key or allows 
      the client a choice of recipient/s.

Total official discretion is retained:

      The legislation will provide that bodies wishing to offer or provide 
      encryption services to the public in the UK will be required to obtain 
      a licence. The legislation will give the Secretary of State discretion 
      to determine appropriate licence conditions.

The licence conditions imply that only large organisations will be able to 
get licences: small organisations will have to use large ones to manage 
their keys (this was the policy outlined last June by a DTI spokesman).  The 
main licence condition is of course that keys must be escrowed, and 
delivered on demand to a central repository within one hour. The mere 
delivery of decrypted plaintext is not acceptable except perhaps from TTPs 
overseas under international agreements.

The effect of all this appears to be:

1. PGP servers will be outlawed; it will be an offence for me to sign your 
   pgp key, for you to sign mine, and for anybody to put my existing signed 
   PGP key in a foreign (unlicensed) directory

2. Countries that won't escrow, such as Holland and Denmark, will be cut out 
   of the Superhighway economy. You won't even be able to send signed 
   medical records back and forth (let alone encrypted ones)

3. You can forget about building distributed secure systems, as even 
   relatively primitive products such as Kerberos would need to have their 
   keys managed by a licensed TTP. This is clearly impractical.  (The paper 
   does say that purely intra-company key management is OK but licensing is 
   required whenever there is any interaction with the outside world, which 
   presumably catches mail, web and so on.)

There are let-outs for banks and Rupert Murdoch:

  Encryption services as an integral part of another service (such as in 
  the scrambling of pay TV programmes or the authentication of credit 
  cards) are also excluded from this legislation.

However, there are no let-outs for services providing only authenticity and 
nonrepudiation (as opposed to confidentiality) services. This is a point 
that has been raised repeatedly by doctors, lawyers and others - giving a 
police officer the power to inspect my medical records might just 
conceivably help him build a case against me, but giving him the power to 
forge prescriptions and legal contracts appears a recipe for disaster. The 
scope for fraud and corruption will be immense.

Yet the government continues to insist on control of, and access to, signing 
keys as well as decryption keys. This shows that the real concern is not 
really law enforcement at all, but national intelligence.

Finally, there's an opportunity to write in and protest:

  The Government invites comments on this paper until 30 May 1997

Though if the recent `consultation' about the recent `government.direct' 
programme is anything to go by, negative comments will simply be ignored.

Meanwhile, GCHQ is pressing ahead with the implementation of an escrow 
protocol (see http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/GCHQ/casm.htm) that is broken 
(see http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/users/rja14/euroclipper.ps.gz).

In Grey's words, ``All over Europe, the lights are going out''

 *** Zimmerman (Mr. PGP) Launches Newsletter 
=============================================================== 
 Ladies, Gentlemen & Cryptographers,

I'm pleased to announce the imminent release of the premier issue of the 
new "Zimmermann Telegram" newsletter. The Zimmermann Telegram will be a 
regularly-published, paper-based, English-language technical update 
newsletter from PGP's engineering staff, and will cover a variety of 
cryptographic and other lighthearted topics which we may otherwise be 
restricted from discussing via electronic media. The newsletter will be 
sent, in compliance with US law, by regular postal mail to anyone 
interested in technical information about PGP -- anywhere in the world.

If you are now developing PGP-related freeware, shareware, commercial or 
academic cryptographic software, or you plan in future to become a 
registered PGP Developer or PGP World Partner (those programs are currently 
under construction and will be formally announced later) or if you are just 
interested in technical information about cryptography, we think you'll 
enjoy reading our newsletter.

In the premier issue, along with important updates regarding changes to the 
PGP packet format, CRC security problems and new extensions to the PGP key 
format which are not available through any other medium, you'll learn about 
the significance of the "Zimmermann Telegram" name. Meanwhile, visit this 
page: <http://www.nara.gov/nara/digital/teaching/zimmermann/zimmerma.html>.

Scheduled to be mailed imminently, the premier issue will be sent free to 
anyone who provides us with a postal mail address. After that, regular 
subscriptions will require a modest fee (to be announced) to cover our 
mailing costs, but we've committed to offering a limited number of free 
one-year subscriptions to interested members of the cryptography community. 
To request your free subscription, please send email to me at:

 *** Help Choose Def Con IV's Happy Hacker Panel 
==========================================================================

Carolyn: Going to Def Con IV, the most insanely great hacker convention in 
the world? It will be held July 11-13 in the Aladdin Hotel and Casino in Ls 
Vegas, Nevada, USA.

Who would you like to hear speak? Def Con organizer Dark Tangent has asked 
us to put on a Happy Hacker panel. Email us with your ideas for who you'd 
like to see on the panel, and what you'd like to hear us talk about and/or 
demonstrate. The people we choose for speakers win -- free admission! a 
cool-looking name tag! And nothing else. But being a Def Con speaker makes 
for great bragging rights, so give it a try, folks.

I've already asked Dark Tangent to give us some of that T1 bandwidth he's 
planning in order to run some newbie hacking sessions alongside all those 
Uberhackers playing Capture the Flag and trying to win prize money for 
destroying firewalls.
