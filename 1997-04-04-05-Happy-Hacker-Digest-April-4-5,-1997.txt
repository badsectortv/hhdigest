 *** Permission to Hack? 
==================================================================

From: "mojoe" <mojoe@wko.com>

 My first hack and staying outa trouble.

 I have found the IP address of the first person I want to friendly hack, I 
have ask if its OK and they said yes, What should I do now? The server is 
running Novell netware and I have and account on it that is only accessible 
though school, but there main t1 IP is open to traffic though the Internet I 
think no web page or anything.. This is worth 20 bonus points please help. 
I only want to get in and leave a msg. saying that I made it that’s it. The 
staying out of trouble comes from all the recent post on the port 19 It is 
killing me to find out this exploit is there any more info on it? I don’t 
want to keep experimenting and end up in trouble. thanks

Please make this anonymous thanks...

Here’s the story...

Me and my roommate at school both have computers.. we are both on an 
Ethernet network.. now we have a little contest going... just for 
fun.. strictly no damage ever caused.. but the idea is to get into 
the others computer, files, email.. etc and leave messages.. 
If we are successful we teach other how we did it. 
Now I just happened to get on this list and its been great so far.. I 
have succeeded in scoring a few points by getting by the password 
block... however we both now have cmos passwords...

What I was wondering is if I have his IP address is there anything I 
can do to get in through it..??   I have used a port scanner and I 
only get 139 open... any ideas on this would be great...  I did have 
one idea but didn’t want to try it without running it by you first. 
Would it be possible to repeat ping his address and do anything 
without getting the sysadmin p******....  i.e. say he was using Netscape 
or something and I pinged him would it cause problems..??

That’s all for now.. Thanks

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=

Carolyn: To mojoe: that port 19 exploit merely makes a computer slow to a 
crawl. It isn’t a way to break in.

To anonymous: ping your buddy’s IP address enough and you have a denial of 
service attack. If your sysdamin discovers you, he or she may get mad. But, 
heck, I flood killer pinged jericho’s box the other day and even he didn’t 
raise a fuss. The trick is, do it from your home computer from either Win 95 
or some kind of Unix instead of from a shell account and your sysadmin 
probably won’t have a clue about *anything* you do.

But the biggest problem for both of you is that it doesn’t matter whether 
your friend has given you permission to break into his account. His ISP 
hasn’t given you permission and will be rather bent out of shape if they 
catch you.

Now if you are determined anyhow to risk trouble, the safest way is to crack 
your friend’s password. Whatever you don’t, don’t try to get into your 
friend’s account by first gaining root access to his ISP. Your problems can 
snowball so fast you’ll get dizzy. You’ll certainly be breaking the law, and 
could accidentally do major damage to your ISP.

IMHO our best info on cracking passwords has been posted in past Digests by 
OD Phreak. Digests are archived under “New” at http://www.infowar.com and

 *** Covering Your Tracks 
===================================================================

From: Valerie Henson <val@nmt.edu>

The best way to (a) not leave a history file and (b) still be able to use 
that wonderful convenient history function is to make your history file 
/dev/null.

In bash, type

bash$ HISTFILE=/dev/null

In tcsh, it *says* that the history file is kept in a variable named 
histfile, which is the full pathname of the history file.  But it doesn't 
work that way on my system.

In tcsh, *theoretically* type

tcsh% unsetenv histfile

And maybe that will work.  Of course, I've *never* heard of a cracker who 
was busted with his history file.

Re: .bash_history / .history -- history files in general. 
 

I've found a easy and most of the time, possible, method is this:

ln -s /dev/null .bash_history

==================================================================== 
 *** Cookie Killer 
====================================================================

From: "Dave Weir" <dsweir@anet-chi.com>

Hey gang, after reading some posts about cookies, and some responses to 
Netscape, and setting the read only attribute on the cookie.txt file, I 
decided to try that on the cookie files within Internet Explorer.

Now there isn't a cookie.txt file like you find in Netscape, but there are 
separate files for all the URLs you have visited.  There are two .dat 
files, now here is the interesting part, when you set the attribute to read 
only on these dat files you will get an interesting error message: 
Error Initializing the cache.  Shutdown all programs and run scandisk or 
chkdsk.  Delete the cache, cookies and history directories in your windows 
directory and then restart IE.  If the problem persists reinstall IE.

Turn the ready only attribute off and the error message goes away.  The dat 
files are Mm256.dat and Mm2048.dat.  The Mm2048 file has a list of the urls 
that you have visited.

Now if you remove these files or delete them, and launch IE the error 
doesn't appear. So my thinking, and I might be wrong is these dat files are 
used with the txt files.  How, I don't know.

Editing one of the dat files I found this inside: 
Client UrlCache MMF Ver 3. (characters that wouldn’t go through email 
deleted)cookie:nfisdsw@www.mot.com/ nfisdsw@www_mot.txt 2).txt

Looks interesting doesn’t it?

Ok I have hacked as much I possibily know.  Tried looking around for other 
sources to cookies within IE. I know cookies work the same for all 
browsers, just that each browser stores them differently.  Would be 
interested in knowing if anyone else has fooled with cookies and EI.

Lates Dudes and dudettes.

Skurp

Carolyn: I have found that if I delete those dat files without also altering 
the Registry, Win 95 simply rewrites them with their former contents every 
time I delete them.

Please keep this anonymous.

I was wondering about something in regards to my user details being stored 
in Netscape 3.01 
I ran Nucleon and it came up with my email address and some other stuff 
about me.

So I decided to have a look in the registry of my Windex PC and opened up 
the HKEY_users directory and then the software directory, I burrowed into 
Netscape’s directory and then the user directory where I found a number of 
strings with the same details.

Am I on the right track if I edit the strings containing my email address 
and name and stuff to read something like screwu@pig.com.au. 
Hopefully this would anonymise me to cookies and server inquiries to my 
browser, I guess if I had been switched on when I did the install I would 
have put bogus details in the first place.

I am really enjoying the Happy Hacker and I am learning a lot:) so thanx to 
all those hoon hackers who show us older newbies how its done, by the way 
I’ve just started my first year in adult college in Information Technology 
and I’m 38 yrs young, but I’m learning a lot more from the  16 yr old geniuses 
who I quake with and go to school with than the teachers.

From: "Dallas Vogel" <dallas@midwest.net>

I was readin one o' your files on begining hacking and it was telling how 
to delete the history file by way of registry 
I think i know an easier way:

1:click on View then Options. 
2:Click on the Navigation tab 
3:Click on View History button 
4:Click on Edit then Select All 
5:then press delete 
Viola a empty history folder

Carolyn: It works if the snoopers you are trying to foil aren’t hackers:)

 *** Hacking SMTP 
=============================================================

From: Padgett 0sirius <padgett@gdi.net>

As to those asking about SMTP Port 25, the best source is RFC 821, 
everything is defined and if you can handle four letter words, the 
syntax is in English. Retrieve rfc821.txt via ftp from ds.internic.net 
in the rfc directory. Warning, do *not* try to dir or ls that directory 
unless you have a lot of time on your hands. RFC 822 is also on SMTP 
but 821 is what you are looking for.

For those who like to roll your own utilities and work from DOS, I've 
been using the Waterloo Utilities for some time now (University of 
Waterloo). All you need is a C compiler (I use Turbo C  mostly - 
archaic but does what I need & doesn't use much room), DOS packet 
driver, and NIC.

BTW, did you know that the "Happy Hacker" was the villain in 
Commonwealth 
Films "Invasion of the Data Snatchers" c.a. 1989 ?

From: Andrew Price <thanos@imsa.edu>

In one of your guides you talked about fake e-mail.  Using Netscape Mail, 
you can give any username and e-mail address as long as you have access to 
a valid mail server.  The header of the received mail does not say 
apparently to/from.  How does Netscape do this? does it use the port 
technique?

Timothy Ward 
ward@carl.all-net.net

Carolyn: Most email programs allow you to specify a different email address 
than the one from which you send it. Your right with your thought that they 
use the “port technique.” They all ultimately use the same commands on the 
SMTP port that you use when you forge email using the techniques of the GTMHH.

From: "John Beck" <blue13@hotmail.com>

     Hi first off I would like to say that I love your mailing list, 
keep up the great work :) Do you know of any other good hackers mailing lists 
that are worth signing up for?? Ok now for the question at hand I have tried 
and tried and tried to use remailers and I just can't do it. I use the right 
procedure using Request-Remailing-To: and the :: in the messages but still I've 
had no success.  I think the remailers that are posted on the web are either 
closed or don't work. Do you know any that work?? I'd really appreciate the 
help. Please e-mail me back as soon as possible.

Carolyn: The creme de la creme of mailing lists that are good for hacking 
are Bugtraq and NT Bugtraq. That presumes, of course, that you are looking 
to actually do hacking. Now if your idea of hacking is “fashion statement” 
and “nuclear flame war” you may do better with the dc-stuff list.

hi, 
 when i look into my isp's (SunOS/System V) /etc/profile, there is 
this chunk of code,

/bin/mail -E 
case $? in 
0) 
echo "You have new mail." 
;; 
2) 
echo "You have mail." 
;; 
esac

I copied it and found out that case 1) is empty mailbox. Are there any 
other cases? I tried man-ing mail and csh, but the flag '-E' does not 
exist.

 *** Linux Woes 
=============================================================== 
 

From: "Stephen James" <SJAMESFLORIDA-WELLINGTON@WORLDNET.ATT.NET>

  This is a technical question, but, in a way in pertains to hacking.  For 
some reason Linux refuses to recognize my internal modem. (If the modem 
doesn't work you can't very far with hacking :-) I've read documentation on 
the 'net from here to kingdom come.  I have DOS/win95/win3.x drivers, but 
you guessed it...Linux can't do "squat."  I've jumpered my bocamodem 
MV.34AI in every way I can think of.

   I've read that I have to do a warm boot with Linux.  If so, then how?

As I said before, this is highly technical, if you don't know, please 
forward it to someone who may.

Many thanks to all of you, 
Steve

Carolyn: On an Intel box (80x86) a warm boot is control-alt-delete. Cold 
boot is turning off the power.

 *** Serious NT Hacking 
==============================================================

Reply-To: Vytautas Vysniauskas <vytasvy@OSF.LT> 
Sender: Bugtraq List <BUGTRAQ@NETSPACE.ORG> 
Comments:     RFC822 error: <W> DATE field duplicated. Last occurrence

Subject:      Fatal bug in NT 4.0 server 
To: BUGTRAQ@NETSPACE.ORG

Hi,

   There exists very serious bug NT 4.0 server. A user who is 
   granted r/o access to any point of a failsystem can easily 
   crash NT 4.0 server. 
 

   EXPLOIT:

   Client user (who is granted r/o access) resides on Linux box 
   with root privileges. Client mounts NT server disk as follows

   linux# smbmount //ntserver/service /mnt -U client_name

   "df" shows mounted volume like

    //ntserver/service            530176  458224    71952     86%   /mnt

    Now when you try to list the volume with  ls /mnt 
    the command hangs (but is possible to kill the process from 
    another root shell).  NT server switches to blue console 
    screen and crashes immediately showing diagnostic message

    *** STOP 0x0000000A (0x00000000, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x8012C28A) 
    IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL 
 

---- 
***  NOTE: to exploit this situation you must have incorrectly 
    working smbmount utility:

    Linux version 2.0.25 
    smbmount utility from smbfs-2.0.1.tgz package 
    (available at ftp.gwdg.de /pub/linux/misc/smbfs or 
     sunsite.unc.edu /pub/Linux/filesystems/smbfs )

    This package requires at least Linux version  2.0.28 
    and contains fixes of a standard smbfs module. So, 
    it is not expected to work correctly with 2.0.25 version. 
    However, smbmount crashes NT server completely...

    The situation was tested several times on two  NT 4.0 servers, 
    always ending up with strictly the same system crash.

    It would be interesting to see does somebody else can reproduce 
    this result ? 
 

QUESTION:

    Additionally, I would like to ask: 
    It is known about big hole in NT 4.0 security system 
    that allows for a user without any access permission to mount NT 
    server root directory (disk C:) in r/w mode and to take a 
    complete control over NT system ? I heard only some little 
    comments but haven't seen a demonstration and/or description 
    of this vulnerability.

    It makes very big doubt about usability of NT 4.0 system. 
    Maybe, it is time to switch to Unix/Samba platform ?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= 
Hi,

System crash  was performed on NT 4.0 server and NT 4.0 workstation 
platforms upgraded with the following patches:

Windows NT version 4.0, build 1381, Service Pack 2

   Q135707Q141239NTOSKRNLFIX was installed on Feb 23, 1997 at 16:41:21. 
   Q163213 TCPIP DRIVER UPDATE was installed on Feb 23, 1997 at 16:41:47. 
   Q163333SERIALFIX was installed on Mar 03, 1997 at 21:43:42. 
   RPC SERVER CPU USAGE FIX was installed on Feb 23, 1997 at 16:41:33. 
 

I think it is VERY ESSENTIAL that Linux client smbmount/smbumount 
utility (from smbfs-2.0.1.tgz package) was compiled using 2.0.29 kernel 
version but used with incompatible 2.0.25 kernel. I have tested that 
smbmount/smbumount works just fine with Linux 2.0.29 client (installation 
of smbfs-2.0.1 package patches smbfs kernel module, so it must be done 
before 2.0.29 kernel is compiled). Compiled binaries (smbmount/smbumount) 
are available at

ftp://puni.osf.lt/pub/windows/ntmount.tgz (~8Kb) 
(md5sum is 3e053ae7d51954c96032aa91ead5364c )

Use it at your risk. It should work correctly with 2.0.29 (patched) kernel 
version, but produces NT system crash when used with 2.0.25 Linux system. 
Probably, something is wrong at filesystem level of NT system...

How this bug was discovered ? 
----------------------------

Initially my goal was to integrate disk space resources of our NT server 
and NFS server (Linux 2.0.25). At the first stage I have installed Samba 
package (version 1.9.16p1) on the NFS server and configured Samba password 
server to be NT server. In such a way Win 95/NT clients can access 
transparently dedicated space of the NFS server. 
The result was very encouraging: 
Samba server (P5/100, 64Mb RAM, 3c579 EISA card, OS=Linux) performance over 
10Mbits/sec LAN was  really better than NT server (P5/133x2, 64MB RAM, 3c595 
PCI card).

I didn't make precise measurements, but copying of large files was up to 
1.5 times faster when exchanging data with Samba server. From a client 
point of view the difference was noticeable in multimedia applications 
(like playing remote MPEG files).

At the second stage my plan was to have disk space integration for 
a UNIX client. I ftp'ed smbfs-2.0.1.tgz package. This package requires 
Linux version 2.0.28 but our Linux servers & workstations were equipped 
with 2.0.25 version. Before recompiling new kernel version ( it is 
quite a long work to do) I have compiled this package using fresh source 
code of the 2.0.29 kernel version (symbolic link /usr/src/linux was changed 
to the top of 2.0.29 source directory). Then my thought  was to test 
compiled smbmount/smbumount binaries on the older kernel version 2.0.25. 
I expected my risk should  be to crash  Linux system rather NT server. 
And ... I was really surprised that nothing wrong happened with Linux 
box (only 'ls' process was hanging up) but NT server was crashing 
immediately.  System crash was reproduced both on NT 4.0 server and 
NT 4.0 workstation  platforms. When a disk mount was performed from 
Linux 2.0.29 client (using the same compiled smbmount/smbumount binaries) 
everything was working just fine.

 *** Serious IRC Hacking 
===========================================================

From: "Crazy J" <crazyj@earthlink.net> 
Howdy Hey Folks;

Well after my last post about writing your own brute force 
like program for Excell in Visual Basic. I have been getting 
allot of questions about Visual Basic in general most of 
which have the common theme of writing programs that 
interact with the Internet. Thus to share the wealth I decided 
to share another source code example with you all and a little 
information on how to write Internet enabled applications with 
Visual Basic.

First we need to cover the topic of talking to the winsock.dll 
(i.e. the Winsock API). There our many ways that one can 
accomplish this, one of which you will need to buy a bottle 
of aspirin before you attempt it for it is error prone. That is to 
port the Winsock header file (winsock.h) that is included with 
Visual C++ and many other windows C and C++ compilers to 
a Visual Basic BAS file (.bas). The second option is to use 
one of the many Internet OLE controls, one of which is used in 
the Internet Relay Chat Client that follows. It is included in the 
Crescent Internet ToolPak Version 3.0 which their is a fully functional 
shareware version located at 
http://crescent.progress.com/crescent/n-citp.html 
which will allow you to try the example below. I like their control pack 
for it gave me the most bang for my buck averaging a little over 10 dollars

per control and ease of use(i.e. no migraines).

Anyway once we got the part of talking to the winsock.dll covered 
we can move on to the fun part coding our application. This is a simple 
example of an Internet Relay Chat Client and will show you not only the 
basics 
of how to work with an Internet OLE control, but will show you the basics 
of establishing a raw IRC connection with a server, staying connected to 
the server, and how to program the functionality into the client to 
automate 
the raw IRC commands.
