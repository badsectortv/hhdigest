MORE WINDOWS PASSWORD HACKS

From: "Steven Alexander" <salexand@cell2000.net> 
Subject: Breaking Windows Security

 Last night I decided to compile a short simple list of ways to crack 
Windows 3.1 and 95 security.  It's really not secure at all.

 Windows3.1 Screensaver

edit C:\windows\control.ini

 Windows 95 Screensaver

Right click on the mouse and go to properties, select the screensaver tab 
and disable the Windows password.

Windows Startup Password Disabling

Rename all of the .PWL files in the windows directory

REN *.PWL *.PW_

 3rd Party Passwords

Try hitting Control+Alt+Del

In Windows 95 edit the

LOAD=

and

RUN=

sections in C:\windows\win.ini

Getting to DOS

Use a boot disk

Run c:\command.com

open command.com with the Write program.  Don't use notepad. 
Choose no conversion and save it over  c:\windows\ winhelp.exe.

When you shut down Windows 95 you can still type commands because you are 
in DOS prompt there is just a graphic over it. Type:

CLS<cr> 
MODE CO80<cr>

Windows 95 Network Login

HIt ctrl+esc 
run command.com

If you want to learn more read the PC Hacking FAQ.  Everyone should also 
read the 2600 #hack FAQ it gives a lot of the necessary info for beginning 
hackers.

Please keep me anonymous (and I'm already subscribed to this)

I was at the Library today, and I got very frustrated at their "At Ease" 
like program, called WinU (I have tried to hack on it at home with the 
shareware version).  I know that their "Staff Only" password is "winu" 
(without the quotes).  But even after that, I was still restricted to 
Explorer that only let me go to C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM and all I could do was 
boring stuff.  I did find a system file editor in that directory (lets 
you edit autoexec.bat, win.ini, ect.).  So what I did to gain access to 
the whole hard drive was, making some dumb extension (I don't remember 
what it was, something like .pbl) run the command.com when I double 
clicked on it (make the icon a tree or something).  I could then run 
every program I wanted, but that still wasn't enough.  I finally found 
the heart of WinU's security.  I looked into the C:\Windows\System.ini 
and found a line that said shell= "C:\blah\blah\Winu.Exe" /startup 
(something like that)  I made a back up of the file and made the line 
say shell= "C:\Windows\Explorer.exe" Then I restarted windows, and I had 
110% access to everything.  Not much to do, only fun demos, full tilt 
pinball, and some other stuff.  Bring your own game, put it on the Start 
Menu (no one's going to see it anyways).

If "winu" isn't the password for the Staff Only desktop, try this: 
Reboot the computer, try to hit F8 when it says Starting Windows 95... 
or if that doesn't work (the time limit might be set to 0) try shutting 
off the computer in the middle of the boot up of Windows.  Turn it on, 
and hit Escape and F8 or F8 and Escape over and over... it should give 
you a selection screen then... now you can goto Command Prompt Only! 
And if all else fails, bring a boot disk!  There are many ways to do 
this, but I can't promise you'll be able to get in.  (It could have a 
Bios Password, not allowing you to add a boot disk, it also might never 
show a "Windows 95 Did Not Boot Properly, Safe Mode?" screen, ^C may not 
be an option, and "winu" might not be their password.) Oh, BTW, don't 
worry about the password it asks you for when you first start windows, 
just hit cancel.  And FYI, the password is in a .PWL file, you can 
rename it (don't delete it, it will reset the whole thing...) and make 
the password what you want, when you're done, delete that and rename the 
original back.

INTERNATIONAL HACKING LAW

(Please keep anonymous.  Thanks!)

>Does anyone know of the laws regarding international hacking?  For example, 
>if I sat here in Blighty (Britain) and hacked a US computer, and left a 
>message on there with my name, address, 
>telephone number, date of birth, national insurance (social sec.) number,

>in a rubber dinghy?  I'd be interested to know.

I do not know if there are any international treaties regarding computer 
crime (if not, I'm sure they're in the works!) but you should be aware 
that the concept of "location" and "jurisdiction" blur -- nay, disappear 
-- when dealing with the Internet.  A hacker in Britain who breaks into 
a U.S. government computer is in violation of U.S. law.  If that hacker 
ever steps foot in the U.S. (or is extradited, which is highly possible 
considering various extradition treaties in existence), that hacker is 
headed for jail, gaol, the pokey, the brig, the Big House, or all of the 
above.

The same applies to the hacker who sits in the rubber dingy -- you've 
eventually got to come ashore somewhere.  And if you were using, say, a 
cellular phone on a U.S. provider, you might also be subject to wire 
fraud provisions.

Courts and prosecutors have used broad interpretations of what falls 
under the law -- the most reliable safeguard is:  if you're not 
specifically granted access, don't access it.  If it ain't yours, don't 
peek.

And yes, I am a lawyer, but this should not be considered legal advice, 
merely a layman's opinion on what he reads in the news -- free legal 
advice is worth what you pay for it.

A sniffer works by putting the NIC into promiscuous mode, forcing the NIC to 
accept every packet on the network.  Since sniffing only requires a physical 
network connection and no packets are sent by the sniffer, there's very 
little you can do to detect one.

If you have a map of all NICs on your network, you can mask out known 
ethernet addresses and monitor for "new" ones suddenly appearing on the net. 
Chances are that's a sniffer or other hacking....

Sniffers are excellent tools to analyze actual traffic on your network, and 
analyze protocol layers.  Wanna see EXACTLY how POP3 works, a sniffer will 
show you... 'course, you could always look up the RFC too...

Ask and you shall receive ;-)

The following are excerpts from the ISS Sniffer FAQ.  It can be found at: 
http://www.pris.bc.ca/tech/faqs/sniff.htm

Regards -- N-TREEG  http://www.ucet.ufl.edu/~jyoung 
P.S.  Sniffers can be an invaluable tool for diagnostics of out of whack 
networks.

How to detect a sniffer running.

To detect a sniffing device that only collects data and does not respond to 
any of the information, 
requires physically checking all your ethernet connections by walking around 
and checking the 
ethernet connections individually.

It is also impossible to remotely check by sending a packet or ping if a 
machine is sniffing.

A sniffer running on a machine puts the interface into promiscuous mode, 
which accepts all the 
packets. On some Unix boxes, it is possible to detect a promiscuous 
interface. It is possible to run 
a sniffer in non-promiscuous mode, but it will only capture sessions from 
the machine it is 
running on. It is also possible for the intruder to do similar capture of 
sessions by trojaning 
many programs such as sh, telnet, rlogin, in.telnetd, and so on to write a 
log file of what the 
user did. They can easily watch the tty and kmem devices as well. These 
attacks will only 
compromise sessions coming from that one machine, while promiscuous sniffing 
compromises all sessions on the ethernet.

For SunOs, NetBSD, and other possible BSD derived Unix systems, there is a 
command

     "ifconfig -a"

that will tell you information about all the interfaces and if they are in 
promiscuous mode. DEC 
OSF/1 and IRIX and possible other OSes require the device to be specified. 
One way to find out 
what interface is on the system, you can execute:

# netstat -r 
     Routing tables

     Internet: 
     Destination      Gateway            Flags     Refs     Use  Interface 
     default          iss.net            UG          1    24949  le0 
     localhost        localhost          UH          2       83  lo0

Then you can test for each interface by doing the following command:

     #ifconfig le0 
     le0: flags=8863<UP,BROADCAST,NOTRAILERS,RUNNING,PROMISC,MULTICAST> 
             inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 255.0.0.1

Intruders often replace commands such as ifconfig to avoid detection. Make 
sure you verify its 
checksum.

There is a program called cpm available on ftp.cert.org:/pub/tools/cpm that 
only works on Sunos 
and is suppose to check the interface for promiscuous flag.

Ultrix can possibly detect someone running a sniffer by using the commands 
pfstat and pfconfig.

pfconfig allows you to set who can run a sniffer 
pfstat shows you if the interface is in promiscuous mode.

These commands only work if sniffing is enabled by linking it into the 
kernel. by default, the sniffer is 
not linked into the kernel. Most other Unix systems, such as Irix, Solaris, 
SCO, etc, do not have 
any flags indication whether they are in promiscuous mode or not, therefore 
an intruder could be 
sniffing your whole network and there is no way to detect it.

Often a sniffer log becomes so large that the file space is all used up. On 
a high volume network, a 
sniffer will create a large load on the machine. These sometimes trigger 
enough alarms that the 
administrator will discover a sniffer. I highly suggest using lsof (LiSt 
Open Files) available from 
coast.cs.purdue.edu:/pub/Purdue/lsof for finding log files and finding 
programs that are accessing the 
packet device such as /dev/nit on SunOs.

Stopping sniffing attacks

Active hubs send to each system only packets intended for it rendering 
promiscuous sniffing useless. 
This is only effective for 10-Base T.

The following vendors have available active hubs:

Well as you have no access to the computer that is suspected to run a 
sniffer, detecting a sniffer is impossible. 
Unless maybe if you cause packet storms and can find a relation between 
them and the behaviour of that other machine (hard disks noises, 
ethernetcard lights, etc....), but then again, you have no proof.

There was stated that you can use some fake passwords very obviously... 
and then check your logs regularly, if they appear, someone has to have 
been watching you... but of course that is not a fool-proof technique 
(and not technically inspired).

If you are on the computer, all you have to do is check the process 
list... or do an ifconfig (info on network adapter status). 
If a network adapter is in PROMISCUOUS mode, you can bet y'r life on it 
someone was/is running a sniffer. 
(PROMISC mode: the network adapter is not selective and accepts all 
packets, even these not addressed to it)

Now I would like to add, that Sniffers are used for other tasks then just 
reading mail or grabbing pwd's, all those who ever had to track down network 
misconfigurations will all confirm this.

Laterz...

PS: Use sniffit instead of esniff... it's much cooler ;)

HACKER HANDLE CHOICES

From: mulder@jumbo.ntplx.net (Hunter Rose) 
Subject: Handle Ideas

an interesting hacking note...

though this is not a technical note, hacker psychology is as interesting as 
it's other side....

handles come in many major types and sizes, but the most common is from 
literary sources (here's a hint: real hackers read, too.) pick a favorite 
author, story, and then character. there you go. movies, video games 
(though more common) and bands are also good choices. also, for an instant 
"hacker handle" try substituting numbers for letters (although this is 
awfully played out, if ya ask me.) for instance, take my brand new nifty 
handle CTHULHU....

author: h.p. lovecraft, master of the soul asphyxiating horror tale.... 
story: call of cthulhu, basis for the amazing cthulhu mythos works that's 
influence spreads throughout society.... 
character: cthulhu, indescribably horrible high priest of the hideous old ones.

easy. be original, and don't worry about duplication.

Handles- 
Pick some name sounding vaguely melodic, something that you would hear 
out of a fantasy book.  For example, in Tolkien Strider's real name is 
Aragorn, there is Galadriel, Gimli, and Legolas.  And the more original, 
the better.  Mine is Krital, my friend's is Liren, and there are many 
other combinations of letters that no one has even stumbled upon yet. 
You could also take your own name and contort it a little. 
Sorry for this completely non-hacking related item,

SENDMAIL QUESTION

From: ae630@freenet.unbc.edu (Tim Gutteridge) 
Subject: Sendmail

 I know how to use the basic parts of sendmail on port 25, such as 
rcpt to and mail from, but when I type in help, I see other commands that 
I can't figure out, such as DNS, expn (I think), and vrfy. Also, what is 
the point of and difference between helo and ehlo? All I can get it to do 
is say hi to me, and ehlo gives me another list of weird commands. 
 I am using telnet://freenet.hut.fi:25. 
 Does anybody know where I can get some documentation on sendmail, too? 
  
 And one more question: What's with the ^T command? On pretty much 
any telnet system that I log onto, whether it's responsive or not, it 
gives me some kind of status report.

 By the way, for those of you trying to hack WIN95 networks, there 
are 3 things that may be helpful:

 -press F3 for a find menu 
 -press the windows key to open programs without even logging on 
 -press F8 when rebooting for a menu, which allows safe mode (no 
  limitations) and the MSDOS prompt

 Hello again, 
                  well I finally figured out the illusive PPP with Linux. 
so what did id do once I logged on to my ISP through LINUX for the first 
time? Well I think to myself  "I'll go play on my favorite New Mexican 
Computer GRANDE!!" well of course like everything new in Linux it barked 
at me "Invalid Host Name" so I eventually figure out !!! wow I have to 
punch in the d*** DNS instead of the host NAME! well this brings me to 
my obvious question... HOW do I configure Finger , Telnet , Lynx etc.. 
to use Names instead of DNS #?

Anonymous post:

To the people that recently installed Linux on a PC. 
Probably the best book I have gotten (for a beginner) is 
The Linux Bible.

It teaches a beginner a lot about Linux and UNIX in general. 
It doesn't use too many large words you dot understand and it starts you off 
like you dot know much about Linux.  It is good even if you just have a shell.

Subject: Redirection and Denial of Service

 Finger and Telnet can both be redirected.  You can even use the command

finger @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@aol.com

as a denial of service attack.

Redirecting Telnet will make the your connection appear to be from the host 
you redirected through.

Whatever floats your boat.

A NEW ANSWER MAN

From: nightshadow1@juno.com (Shadrack D Marcy)

 For those that really want to hack you first need to know how to 
program in BASIC, C and know UNIX/ Linux systems like the back of your 
hand. I recently (yesterday) bought a 486 Compudyne laptop specifically 
to run Linux. I learned that in order to know what the heck I am doing on 
Linux I have to be able to program in Basic C or know Unix script. 
Fortunately, at work we run a  Unix system and I know basic Unix 
commands.  I didn't  have to learn from a text file from some 13 yr old 
hacker trying to make a name for  himself by trying to regurgitate a 
hacker text file from 1987 and passing it off as a current "How to Hack" 
file. 
  If anyone knows of a current FAQ or text file  "How To" I would 
greatly appreciate a post to my box. If you need help on hacking you can 
post to my box as well. I only do harmless hacking, of course (*wink*). I 
actually do hack for the common good of removing the trash we have on the 
net, yet sometimes that temptation to smack a site that has porn or spam 
is just TOO tempting (*evil grin*). 
 I would also like to say THANKS to Carolyn for helping my roommate 
(who I believe wrote you earlier this week) for helping him learn how to 
do what you have. Our conflicting schedules and my lack of time to teach 
him have made it hard for me to catch him up on the latest craze of 
hacking that is sweeping our great nation. So all you aspiring hackers 
that are flooding Carolyn with questions, well, you can flood me too. I 
will give you what I know, but PLEASE don't ask me about my hacks nor ask 
me of illegalities. If you want to do illegal things you're on the wrong 
list.

Thanx Shad!!!!

P.S. I'm in Atlanta...anyone out there that wants to share some ideas and 
just hang and BS about comps and stuff, just e-mail me! Address it to
