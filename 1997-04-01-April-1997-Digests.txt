 *** NT Crack Version 2 Released 
===============================================================

Sender: Windows NT BugTraq Mailing List <NTBUGTRAQ@RC.ON.CA> 
From: Jonathan Wilkins <jwilkins@SECNET.COM>

NT Crack version 2 has been released.

I apologize for how soon it follows the initial release but I 
think that a massive optimization in speed in the new version 
justifies a new release.

We ran a user list of length 1006 with a word list of around 860,000 in 
5 minutes 30 seconds on a Pentium 133 with 32MB RAM running 
Windows NT Server.

Roughly 2,606,000 cracks per second.. 
The old version seemed to get around 15,000 cracks per second..

This is due to Windows NT's lack of any salt functions as well as a 
few optimizations regarding the encryption routine and a change in 
the way NTCrack processes user files.

The new version is also independent of the cygwin.dll and so is 
much smaller but it seems that the cygwin libraries are marginally 
faster. When NTCrack is compiled and linking in the cygwin 
libraries it was somewhat faster but I decided to release the smaller 
version because our little ISDN net connection was getting a little 
choked.  Anyone who wishes to mirror this program should contact 
me via email at jwilkins@secnet.com

Speed freaks are encouraged to compile their own copies 
for various UNIX platforms rather than deal with the 
overhead of Windows.

One other feature was added, the program now attempts to use 
the username as the password.  I have found in many smaller 
offices, especially ones that run NT or Netware, that users are 
generally uneducated about what constitutes a good password 
and so will often use their username. 
 

                                        Jonathan Wilkins

again, I am sorry to re-release so soon, but I really believe that 
the improvements justify it..

the new files are only ~22k

Carolyn: I just spoke with Dead Addict, a famed hacker and Microsoft 
employee, on this issue. DA says that while a password of a given length is 
easier to crack on NT systems, NT will accept passwords of much greater 
length than Unix systems. There are also utilities which prevent an NT user 
from entering a password that is too short or too easy to guess. But NT 
sysadmins must remember to install a program that will force users to choose 
these high-power passwords.

 ** Preventing Denial of Service Attacks 
==================================================================

From: "Mishari \"CykiX\" Muqbil" <mishari@thepentagon.com>

Hi. I've got more stuff on port 19 :-) 
Basically, instead of using telnet and piping it to port 7, another 
HIGHLY effective way is to just use good ol' lynx. That's right, the 
good little goody goody hostile java applet-proof browser has a deep 
dark secret: 
lynx http://localhost:19/ 
Notice the number of bytes transferred increasing rapidly? 
Use screen to have several sessions of lynx running. That UNIX box is 
gonna Crawl! Here's another something which works: 
lynx http://my.isp.net:19/ 
Seems to disconnect the modem from the ISP. Anyone here has the same 
problem? 
And... *drumroll please* MSiE! Yes! Micro$0ft hasn't been doing their 
homework. Port 19 hasn't been disabled and it has a much more drastic 
effect than lynx on a windows NT environment (http://localhost:19) Check 
it out, it's worth a few laughs. NetScape has done their homework well 
and disabled access to the major ports with security hazards. e.g. port 
19 and port 7. Three cheers to Netscape!

Carolyn: Thanks for the warnings! I can't emphasize too much how important 
it is to close not only 19 -- the worst of the lamer denial of service ports 
-- but let's add 7 (echo) to the list, too. It would be soooo easy for some 
self-styled "kewl dood" to offer a download site for a program that any 
idiot with Win 95 and AOL could use to crash a major ISP.

 *** Telenet is *Not* Telnet Misspelled 
=====================================================================

From: brian <brianzad@asan.com>

I thought Telenet was a misspelling of telnet until the question about 
the two was posted.  I couldn't find the Telenet/Telnet article at 
infowar.com so I put a link to the article that describes Telenet at 
http://www.asan.com/users/brianzad. 
The article was written by Revelation of LOA.  It explains Telenet.

I found it works on almost any system that uses BASH I just have a fake 
.bash_history on my comp 
for when I use BASH but I usually use SH cause it doesn't log but here is how I 
have it on my comp 
for fake bash files 
  
|----BASH---===================|1-hour_on 
$Home-----Fakelogs------| 
  |2-hour_on 
                                   |-----SU----- 
          |20-minutes_on 
                                   | 
                                   |----lastlog--

AND the 1 hour log is about 1 hours worth of stuff like saying harmless 
things like and u can make it 
switch shells if you run out of ideas.

PINE 
LYNX 
IRC 
ls 
rm work_paper 
ksh

After you upload this rm .bash_history (in a shell other than bash) then 
rename 1-hour_on to .bash_history 
its really no big deal

What gain you gain by deleting your history file? You would then later have 
to waste additional time typing in repetitious commands! If you want to 
*edit* your .bash_history just use fc [-e editor_name] [-n] [-l] [-r] 
[first] [last]

e - editor name (vi or emacs) 
n - suppress command #s 
l - lists matched commands 
r - reverse order 
first/last - # range of commands

OR 
to use another .bash_history, use history [-r|w|a|n] [filename] 
r - read the content of the current history file and make them the current 
history file 
w - write the command history to the history file (overwriting) 
a - appends the history file 
n - range

 *** Oh, no, did I really surf THERE??:(:( 
=============================================================

From: gtmhh@juno.com (M. A David)

This is a tip for the Win95 Netscaping community :)

Here's a fast way to clear your URL History in Netscape (the list of 
domains that you see when you click on the down arrow to the right of the 
Enter URL box).  The basic idea has already been "put on the table", but 
its much faster than editing the registry every time.

The idea (in case you didn't get a chance to read it when it was put out) 
is to get into the registry (Run => Regedit) and get to the Netscape 
directory which contains what was previously in the Netscape.ini file. 
It is under "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\netscape\netscape navigator". 
When there, you will be looking for the folder that says "URL History". 
When there, DO NOT delete URL_1, URL_2, etc., (if you do, don't worry -- 
Get out of registry editor, Load Netscape, Exit Netscape, load registry 
-- Go to folder listed above)  Press enter for each of the URL_?? and 
clear out the Value Data.  Do that for them all, and the history in the 
pull-down menu will be cleared.

Now, to do this in 2 mouse clicks: 
1)  Load registry 
2) Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/software/netscape/netscape navigator/URL 
History and then clear it out as listed above. 
3) Click on the URL History folder. 
4) Click on Registry (on the menu bar) and select "Export registry file" 
5) I'd save it on tha desktop.  Name it anything you want. 
6)  Next time you want to clear your History, 2x click on the file you 
just made!

make sure you load the Ethernet card driver.  if you have a newer (2.x) 
kernel you can use command like "insmod 3c5x9" in one of you start-up 
files (like rc.inet1) of better yet recompile you kernel with the card 
support...

 ... Which leads to a very interesting Denial Of Service attack: What 
happens if I blacklist (along with various other 
"undesirable" accounts) and share my blacklist with everyone who 
chooses (foolishly) to run Dead Bolt?  White Supremacists will blacklist

half a brain will blacklist *@*aol.com.  Or are there mechanisms in 
place to keep these abuses from happening?  I should hope so.

I might as well follow up on my own posting: Hackers young and old 
like to play with computers and peripherals. Oddly enough, I don't see 
many who get their phones into the game. That's what I'd like to 
encourage. You don't need a T1/DS1 line; all you need is ISDN (well it 
could probably be done with analog but I'm more interested in 
digital). So why don't you hackers take a look at the whitepaper on 
"The Java Telephony API: An Overview" at:

http://www.javasoft.com/products/javatel/Overview.html (whitepaper) 
http://www.javasoft.com/products/javatel (home directory for JTAPI)

This is an opportunity to be ultra cool: ISDN, Java, esoteric 
hacking, ... All you need is an ISDN NT1 box like an Ascend P50 or 
something a heck of a lot less expensive (anybody know about that?) 
and some software. Then you can start to record phone conversations on 
various storage devices (hard disks or whatever you like) and edit 
them, or delete them, ... As in most hacking adventures, there is an 
element of risk: You can't record interstate conversations unless you 
inform all parties. Usually intrastate recording is okay with the 
narcs as long as one party knows it's being done.

Disclaimer: I'm not an attorney. I don't know for sure what is legal 
and illegal so I advise you to contact your local exchange company 
(LEC) before you start recording.

Anyway, doesn't this sound like hacker heaven? Who will write the 
first JTAPI code for the rest of us? Not me; I'm just learning Java. I 
can help with the ISDN signaling protocols but an experienced Java 
hacker will have to get us going with the code. Better know your beans 
too.

You can get my ISDN UNI signaling files by anonymous ftp to 
alpha2.uwm.edu: cd to the /pub/Veda directory and get the gzip'ed files. 
One is the AutoCAD diagram, the other the first chapter of the manual in 
html and gifs. Plot the gunzip'ed isdn.dwg on D size paper. I think it's 
36"x48" but it may actually be 24"x36" -- you can figure it out if you 
play with the plotter long enough.

Let me make another statement for the sake of the university cybercops: 
This is an educational exercise. I'm not selling anything. Nada. Rien.

Let me know how you progress. Happy Hacking, mes amis!

 *** Customize Your Internet Explorer Animated Logo 
=============================================================

From: "Tom Ben-Yehoshua" <tom@lightnet.co.il>

This is for all the guys and gals querying about customizing the 
IE-rotating logo... 
Well, sorry this took so long, but I've recently re-installed MS-IExplorer 
and this cleared the registry entries 
required to make this change... so.. here we go.. 
To customize the rotating logo or/and the toolbar background image in IE 
follow these steps:

Step 1 : get into the registry (typically by typing REGEDIT in the 
Start>Run box. 
Step 2 : open HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > Microsoft > Internet Explorer 
and    place the cursor on +Toolbar (this should so you Default, Layout, 
NoText and VisibleBands at the right frame. 
Step 3 : click on the right frame and then choose from the Edit menu New > 
String Value

NOW ....

to change the rotating logo add the following string/s :

Effect                   |  String                  | Value 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
change the small  |SmBrandBitmap    | path to bitmap* 
ie rot. logo            |                           | 
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
change the normal | BrandBitmap       | path to bitmap* 
ie rot. logo            |                           | 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
change the toolbar |BackBitmap         | path to bitmap** 
backgroung gfx      |                           |

* for this to work you need to make a strip in BMP format containing the 
  images to animate (if you want an example, e-mail me)

** just any image in BMP format

From: rydell@juno.com (Lupus C Kiyoti)

 I've been wondering if anyone in the Fingerlakes Region of NY 
would be interested in starting some sort of meeting if we're close 
enough.  This area used to have a large hack scene back in the early 
nineties and late eighties but well after a LARGE crackdown everyone 
disappeared. 
 Things have changed now most of the old ones have moved away 
(read: grown up, got married, got jobs) except for one who runs a local 
bbs, I've taught what I've learned to two or three other kids and there 
is one mac hacker nearby (hello!  I know your reading this) but it'd be 
good if we were able to get in contact. 
 Email me if your somewhere near the Finger Lakes (I'm closest to 
Cayuga) and yes I KNOW there are ppl in NYC... let's organize some of the 
others =)

Who turned against GALF? To 'turn' implies that it was a former member or

That isn't the point monkey. The point is our agreement was for YOU to try 
to hack the box. It doesn't give me conniption fits to get scanned, but for 
you to bring others in on it. I have had about 5 serious attempts a day 
recently. I am not worried about that either. Today I gave another person 
permission to try to hack the box, just as a challenge to him and me.

Oh.. if anyone comes from escape.com, I imagine it will be GALF again. And 
GALF like everyone else who asks, has permission to try.

That is slander you stupid bitch. Quit your pathetic monkey shit out. "to 
them again" implies I have a) threatened them already, or b) actually done. 
I have done neither. Your f****** "uber-friends" have port scanned me. That 
is more than I have done to them.

When you catch GALF, then I MIGHT believe you.

Dare to evolve Carolyn. I am not scared to state my opinion. I respect 
both because they are doing what they feel is right, at risk to 
themselves, to get a message out that they believe in. I do the SAME THING 
in my own way, through my zine. We each chose a different way to make our 
marks on the world, theirs is just different than mine. Besides, you are 
under this stupid impression that I am the only one who feels the way I do. 
There are a lot more, but they don't waste their time explaining simple 
concepts to you.

Your continued threats of "collimate spike" are getting really old. Your 
attempt to link me to being a member of GALF or a partner in crime to 
Johnny are getting older. Now, your attempt to imply I have threatened or 
rm'ed UTEP are enough. 1) I do not know who GALF is.  2) I have only had 
email contact with johnny (which you and I have discussed at greater 
length) 3) I have never even 'pinged' UTEP. Remember that.

Because Carolyn has no experience with phreaking.. just like hacking.

Hmmm, you are looking for a fight aren't you?  Well, unfortunately not all 
of us suffer from what you do - A huge pre-pubescent ego.  I know it may 
seem odd to you, Jericho, but *GOOD* hackers don't go picking fights so they 
can boost their egos but rather use their knowledge mostly in defense from 
people like you.  Yes, I CAN download "Up Yours".  Yes, I CAN put in your 
e-mail address.  Yes, I CAN subscribe you to hundreds of list-servs.  The 
thing is, that doesn't take a brain!  Laughing at people like you and having 
pride in your abilities and knowing when to use them does.  If you'd like to 
continue this in e-mail, feel free.

If you'd like to mail-bomb me there, feel free!  Really!  I would be 
overjoyed if you would because then you would simply prove to everyone 
on this list how much of a lamer you really are.  Now, if you'd like 
to hack into Juno and disable my account I would respect your 
abilities, I'd still hate you but I'd respect your ability to hack 
Juno's minor security defenses.  Catch you all later

Carolyn: For the record, no post on the Happy Hacker list has claimed that 
jericho is a member of GALF or that he is angry johnny (the mass email 
bomber). To make such a claim without sufficient evidence in a public forum 
would be libel. However, a number of posts, for example 
wraith@dimensional.com, have noted jericho's close emotional identification 
with these people. But emotional identification does not equal identity. In 
trying to hunt down computer criminals, it is wise to keep in mind Will 
Rogers' dictum: "It isn't what you don't know that hurts you, it's what you 
know that ain't so." So please do not jump to conclusions about probable 
motivations for jericho's recent posts.
